His courage\r\nwas inspiring, and the Governor's response struck a chord with\r\neveryone in that room. \r\nhttp://email.vervemail.com/ct/45851582:JtB9pbrNN:m:3:1818111541:DB73AF434B8B2FBB3D04A0A33B739CCB:r\r\n\r\nShare the video on Facebook by clicking here\r\nhttp://email.vervemail.com/ct/45851583:JtB9pbrNN:m:3:1818111541:DB73AF434B8B2FBB3D04A0A33B739CCB:r\r\n    \r\nThanks, \r\n   \r\nNicole Sizemore\r\nChris Christie for President\r\n\r\nPaid for by Chris Christie for President, Inc.\r\n\r\nContributions to Chris Christie for President, Inc. are not tax\r\ndeductible as charitable contributions for federal income tax\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nYou can view this email in your web browser here: http://email.vervemail.com/p/vJtB9pbrNN\r\n\r\nP.O.

In the past year, I have spent 66 days in New Hampshire-\r\nmore days than any other candidate for President- because I know\r\nhow seriously you take your responsibility to see the candidates\r\nbefore you make up your mind. \r\n\r\nBefore you cast your ballot on Tuesday, February 9th, I hope you\r\nwill take the time to join me at one of the events below so you\r\ncan meet me in-person, ask me any questions you might have, and\r\nhear me give you straightforward answers without Washington, D.C.\r\ndouble-talk or scripted talking points. \r\n\r\nPlease see below for a list of my upcoming town halls.

I look\r\nforward to seeing you at the events below! \r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\n-Mary Pat Christie\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\r\nFrom: Chris Christie \r\nDate: Sun, Jan 31, 2016 at 5:25 PM\r\nSubject: Join me on my final Town Hall Tour before the NH Primary\r\nTo: Mary Pat Christie\r\n\r\nFriends,\r\n\r\nPlease join me on my final town hall tour before you cast your\r\nvote in the historic 100th New Hampshire Presidential Primary. \r\n\r\nWhen I launched my New Hampshire campaign at the historic Sandown\r\nTown Hall in June, I made a commitment to the people of New\r\nHampshire that I would honor your First In The Nation tradition\r\nby holding public town hall meetings all across the Granite\r\nState. In the past year, I have spent 66 days in New Hampshire-\r\nmore days than any other candidate for President- because I know\r\nhow seriously you take your responsibility to see the candidates\r\nbefore you make up your mind. \r\n\r\nBefore you cast your ballot on Tuesday, February 9th, I hope you\r\nwill take the time to join me at one of the events below so you\r\ncan meet me in-person, ask me any questions you might have, and\r\nhear me give you straightforward answers without Washington, D.C.\r\ndouble-talk or scripted talking points. \r\n\r\nPlease see below for a list of my upcoming town halls. I look\r\nforward to seeing you on the trail this week. \r\n\r\nYours Truly,\r\n\r\n-Chris\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                      You're\r\nInvited                                                        \r\nChris Christie's Town Hall Tour                                  \r\n                                                                 \r\n                                                                 \r\n    \r\n\r\nTown Hall Meeting in Hopkinton\r\nDATE: Monday, February 1, 2016                                   \r\n                     TIME: 4:30 PM *Doors open at 3:30 PM, town\r\nhall meeting starts at 4:30 PM                                   \r\n                     LOCATION: Hopkinton Town Hall Building, 330\r\nMain Street, Hopkinton, NH 03229                                 \r\n                       Town Hall Meeting in Hopkinton            \r\n                                            \r\n\r\nBus Tour Kickoff & Special Town Hall Meeting in Nashua\r\nDATE: Monday, February 1, 2016                                   \r\n                     TIME: 8:30 PM *Doors open at 7:30 PM, town\r\nhall meeting starts at 8:30 PM                                   \r\n                     LOCATION: Nashua Community College -\r\nAutomotive Building, 505 Amherst St, Nashua, NH 03063            \r\n                                            Bus Tour Kickoff &\r\nSpecial Town Hall Meeting in Nashua                              \r\n                          \r\n\r\nGet Out The Vote Kickoff with Chris Christie and Special Guest\r\nMeg Whitman\r\nDATE: Tuesday, February 2, 2016                                  \r\n                      TIME: 9:30 AM *Doors open at 8:30 AM, event\r\nstarts at 9:30 AM                                                \r\n        LOCATION: Christie for President NH Headquarters, 20\r\nWashington Pl, Bedford, NH 03110                                 \r\n                       Get Out The Vote Kickoff with Chris\r\nChristie!                                                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTown Hall Meeting in Epping with Special Guest Meg Whitman\r\nDATE: Tuesday, February 2, 2016                                  \r\n                      TIME: 11:30 AM *Doors open at 10:30 AM,\r\ntown hall meeting starts at 11:30 AM                             \r\n                           LOCATION: Epping American Legion, 232\r\nCalef Hwy, Epping, NH 03042                                      \r\n                  RSVP to the Town Hall Meeting in Epping        \r\n                                                \r\n\r\nTown Hall Meeting in Londonderry with Special Guest Meg Whitman\r\nDATE: Tuesday, February 2, 2016                                  \r\n                      TIME: 6:00 PM *Doors open at 5:00 PM, town\r\nhall meeting starts at 6:00 PM                                   \r\n                     LOCATION: Londonderry Highschool, 295\r\nMammoth Road, Londonderry, NH 03053                              \r\n                          RSVP to the Town Hall Meeting in\r\nLondonderry                                                      \r\n  \r\n\r\nTown Hall Meeting in Lebanon with Special Guest Meg Whitman\r\nDATE: Wednesday, February 3, 2016                                \r\n                        TIME: 9:00 AM *Doors open at 8:30 AM,\r\ntown hall meeting starts at 9:00 AM                              \r\n                          LOCATION:  Salt Hill Pub, 2 W.

After personally meeting with nearly every Republican\r\ncandidate for President, we firmly believe that Chris Christie is\r\nthe best equipped to face these challenges, and we proudly\r\nendorsed him for President.\r\n \r\nAs a former US Attorney who prosecuted and convicted terrorists\r\nin the immediate aftermath of 9/11, Governor Christie has the\r\nstrength and experience to stand up for American interests and\r\nthe compassion to believe in the potential of the American\r\npeople. The times are too challenging to take a chance on\r\ninexperience - and no candidate is more tested and ready than\r\nChris Christie. \r\n\r\nIf you haven't yet, please go vote for Chris Christie. He's ready\r\nto be our President.\r\n\r\nNeed to find your polling place?

He\r\nhas a record of results in New Jersey, which has lowered\r\nrecidivism and incarceration rates for nonviolent drug offenders.\r\nNew Jersey's success under Governor Christie's leadership\r\nestablishing drug courts that mandate treatment instead of\r\nincarceration is a model for the rest of the country. \r\n\r\nGovernor Christie's views on drug addiction can be best summed up\r\nby himself in a video that was seen over 8.6 million times.

Blank states are too close to call.\r\n\r\nOver the past month, polls have shown us winning Iowa, Ohio,\r\nMaine, Florida, Nevada, and North Carolina. If we maintain our\r\nleads in those six states, we can reliably claim 266 electoral\r\nvotes. Hillary can claim 193. But we'd still have 4 electoral\r\nvotes to go.\r\n \r\nPolls show us close in New Hampshire, Colorado, and Pennsylvania.\r\nWinning just any one of those states would lead us to victory.\r\n \r\nWe are currently executing a highly costly early voting push and\r\nget-out-the-vote operation to ensure identified Trump supporters\r\nmake it to the polls before Election Day. We are also planning a\r\n$140 million-dollar ad blitz in battleground states to lead us to\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\nJohn: with just 13 days left, we have a few paths to win.

Because she knows when it comes to the\r\nissues, my father's plans and ideas are better than hers, hands\r\ndown.\r\n \r\nWe cannot afford to stand by and let her get away with this,\r\nthat's why my father is putting in $10 million of his own money\r\nto add to your contribution.\r\n \r\nCan I tell my father that you're fighting with us by contributing\r\n$250, $100, $50, $25 or even $5 right now?\r\nhttp://email.vervemail.com/ct/49373999:JJ5DXomNJ:m:3:1818111541:39E91FEE85848EB3CBF4D873E21EDEBF:r\r\n \r\nLike I said John, Hillary knows that she can't compete against\r\nmy father's plans to secure our borders, cut our tax rates, and\r\nrepeal and replace this disastrous health care debacle called\r\nObamaCare.\r\n \r\nAnd don't let her tell you otherwise.\r\n \r\nShe's lying to us John, but she's done that before. This time\r\nthough, we're not letting her get away with it.

My father is ramping up his schedule,\r\nmeeting as many patriots as possible nationwide.

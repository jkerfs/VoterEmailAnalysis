I hope your new year is off to a fantastic\r\nstart and you're fired up about electing Ted to be our next\r\npresident this year! To start off 2016, I wanted to share a note\r\nwith you that I sent to our staff just a few days ago that\r\nhighlights what we've accomplished together since launching the\r\ncampaign at Liberty University on March 23rd:\r\n        \r\nFinancial strength:\r\n        \r\n            We concluded 2015 raising almost $47 million.\r\n            Our Super PACs have been reported to be the second\r\nbest funded of the GOP field.\r\n            We received over 690,000 donations with an average\r\ndonation of just over $67.\r\n            \r\n                These donors cover 66% of all zip codes in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n                Over 10,000 of our donors are \"sustainers\" who\r\ncommitted to contribute on an automatic, monthly basis, and\r\nprovide enough recurring revenue ($500,000 a month) to fund for\r\nour entire field operation.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n        \r\n        An unrivaled political organization:\r\n        Emphasizing our commitment to running a national\r\ncampaign, we have announced State Leadership Teams, 1,400 strong\r\nin membership, in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada,\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oklahoma,\r\nTennessee, Texas, Virginia, Mississippi, Minnesota, Florida,\r\nArizona, Michigan, and Washington. We've also announced State\r\nChairs in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Idaho, and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n        In the first four primary and caucus states: Iowa, New\r\nHampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, we've built a team that is\r\nthe envy of the GOP field with county chairmen in place in all\r\n171 counties. And after the first four states, we have\r\ncongressional district coordinators in place in each of the 163\r\ncongressional districts that comprise the 24 states that hold\r\ntheir primary or caucus before March 15th. We are also actively\r\nrecruiting precinct chairmen to serve in each of these states to\r\nmobilize supporters as it comes time to vote or caucus.\r\n        Additionally, our leadership teams have access to over\r\n175,000 volunteers across the nation who have signed up to help\r\nmake Ted Cruz our next president. Many of those volunteers have\r\nalready joined our Strike Force at Camp Cruz where we are housing\r\nour volunteers in Iowa.  They are working 12 hour shifts and\r\nexceeding their nightly call and door-knocking goals. Camp Cruz\r\nhas been such a great success we're opening a second dorm to\r\nexpand our Strike Force in Iowa, and we will be taking the Strike\r\nForce to New Hampshire.\r\n        We're also recruiting members of diverse coalitions to\r\nsupport Ted. To date, over 29,000 Americans from all walks of\r\nlife have signed up to join our Veterans and Military,\r\nMillennials, Teens, Liberty Leaders, African Americans, Small\r\nBusiness, Faith Leaders, Pro-Life, Women, Hispanic, Home\r\nSchoolers, Lawyers, Second Amendment, Tea Party, Sportsmen, and\r\nFarmers coalitions.\r\n        Coalescing Courageous Conservatives:\r\n        Recently, Brent Bozell wrote in Breitbart to say, \"Ted\r\nCruz is surging. He's on top in Iowa. He's gaining ground\r\neverywhere else. He has organizations in place in every state\r\nthat matters... It's time for the movement to rally around Ted\r\nCruz, to make him the next president of the United States.\"\r\n        And that's exactly what we're seeing happen. We have seen\r\nconservative leaders both nationally, and in early primary and\r\ncaucus states go all in for Ted. Leaders like Brent Bozell, Shane\r\nVander Haart, Manny Roman, Ken Cuccinelli, Dr. James Dobson, the\r\nNational Organization for Marriage, Bob Vander Plaats, Alan\r\nSteinberg, Richard Viguerie, Andrew McCarthy, Ann-Marie Murrell,\r\nTroy Newman, Ginni Thomas, Rep. Steve King, Dr. Michael Brown,\r\nJudge Paul Pressler, former Rep. Bob Barr, Gun Owners of America,\r\nthe National Federation of Republican Assemblies, Ron Robinson,\r\nRep. Jim Bridenstine, and so many more.\r\n        As influential Iowa radio host Steve Deace said in his\r\nendorsement video \"I think [Ted Cruz] is our best chance to\r\npreserve American exceptionalism for the next generation... do\r\nnot wait until the end. Ted Cruz has already put together the\r\nresources, the resume and the organization it takes to move the\r\ncountry back to liberty. Let's get on board now, let's unite now\r\nso that we can take on Washington, D.C. tomorrow.\"\r\n        What the press is saying about our campaign:\r\n        Cruz has Trump, and the rest of the field, beat on\r\norganization. - Politico\r\n        Ted Cruz has assembled an impressive presidential\r\ncampaign structure in Iowa, veteran political observers here say,\r\nwith one going so far as to describe Cruz's campaign as perhaps\r\n\"the most sophisticated\" the first-in-the-nation caucus state has\r\never witnessed. - Cedar Rapids Gazette\r\n        Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is making a\r\nbig bet on building a strong organization outside of the four\r\nearly voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and\r\nNevada. - Nashville Public Radio\r\n        Cruz is widely regarded as the most deeply organized\r\ncandidate in the South, a region that will have outsize influence\r\nin 2016, as many of the states vote on the same day. - Politico\r\n        The Cruz campaign combines a traditional get-out-the-vote\r\noperation - making phone calls and knocking on doors - with\r\nmodern data analytics to identify and mobilize supporters,\r\nbeginning with Iowa on Feb. 1. - Associated Press\r\n        The anti-establishment angst that Cruz stokes may have\r\nleft him isolated in the Senate, but it has also fueled his\r\ncampaign on the road, where he has cultivated an almost cult-like\r\nbase that views him as a lone wolf with the courage to stand up\r\nto Republican Party leaders they believe are no longer fighting\r\nfor them. - Bloomberg\r\n        The months ahead:\r\n        Some campaigns are focused solely on a man, some on a\r\nmovement. Ours is a hybrid of the two built to win. We have\r\nbrought together, and continue to build, a grassroots army of\r\ncourageous conservatives committed to electing Ted Cruz to\r\nreignite the promise of America. Just under a month away from the\r\nstart of the caucuses and primaries we have a network in place\r\nwith the resources required to win that is the envy of every\r\nother campaign. \r\n        There's still plenty of work to be done to make Ted the\r\nRepublican nominee and the next President, but as we begin 2016,\r\nwe are exactly where we want to be. Go. Fight. Win.\r\n        This is OUR time!\r\n        Jeff Roe\r\n        Campaign Manager\r\n        Cruz for President\r\n        P.S.

RSVP To Join Ted Cruz Next Week!  "}, {"body": "\r\n\r\nHello Friend,\r\n        \r\nHere we are -- 2016! I hope your new year is off to a fantastic\r\nstart and you're fired up about electing Ted to be our next\r\npresident this year! To start off 2016, I wanted to share a note\r\nwith you that I sent to our staff just a few days ago that\r\nhighlights what we've accomplished together since launching the\r\ncampaign at Liberty University on March 23rd:\r\n        \r\nFinancial strength:\r\n        \r\n            We concluded 2015 raising almost $47 million.\r\n            Our Super PACs have been reported to be the second\r\nbest funded of the GOP field.\r\n            We received over 690,000 donations with an average\r\ndonation of just over $67.\r\n            \r\n                These donors cover 66% of all zip codes in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n                Over 10,000 of our donors are \"sustainers\" who\r\ncommitted to contribute on an automatic, monthly basis, and\r\nprovide enough recurring revenue ($500,000 a month) to fund for\r\nour entire field operation.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n        \r\n        An unrivaled political organization:\r\n        Emphasizing our commitment to running a national\r\ncampaign, we have announced State Leadership Teams, 1,400 strong\r\nin membership, in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada,\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oklahoma,\r\nTennessee, Texas, Virginia, Mississippi, Minnesota, Florida,\r\nArizona, Michigan, and Washington. We've also announced State\r\nChairs in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Idaho, and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n        In the first four primary and caucus states: Iowa, New\r\nHampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, we've built a team that is\r\nthe envy of the GOP field with county chairmen in place in all\r\n171 counties. And after the first four states, we have\r\ncongressional district coordinators in place in each of the 163\r\ncongressional districts that comprise the 24 states that hold\r\ntheir primary or caucus before March 15th. We are also actively\r\nrecruiting precinct chairmen to serve in each of these states to\r\nmobilize supporters as it comes time to vote or caucus.\r\n        Additionally, our leadership teams have access to over\r\n175,000 volunteers across the nation who have signed up to help\r\nmake Ted Cruz our next president. Many of those volunteers have\r\nalready joined our Strike Force at Camp Cruz where we are housing\r\nour volunteers in Iowa.  They are working 12 hour shifts and\r\nexceeding their nightly call and door-knocking goals. Camp Cruz\r\nhas been such a great success we're opening a second dorm to\r\nexpand our Strike Force in Iowa, and we will be taking the Strike\r\nForce to New Hampshire.\r\n        We're also recruiting members of diverse coalitions to\r\nsupport Ted. To date, over 29,000 Americans from all walks of\r\nlife have signed up to join our Veterans and Military,\r\nMillennials, Teens, Liberty Leaders, African Americans, Small\r\nBusiness, Faith Leaders, Pro-Life, Women, Hispanic, Home\r\nSchoolers, Lawyers, Second Amendment, Tea Party, Sportsmen, and\r\nFarmers coalitions.\r\n        Coalescing Courageous Conservatives:\r\n        Recently, Brent Bozell wrote in Breitbart to say, \"Ted\r\nCruz is surging. He's on top in Iowa. He's gaining ground\r\neverywhere else. He has organizations in place in every state\r\nthat matters... It's time for the movement to rally around Ted\r\nCruz, to make him the next president of the United States.\"\r\n        And that's exactly what we're seeing happen. We have seen\r\nconservative leaders both nationally, and in early primary and\r\ncaucus states go all in for Ted. Leaders like Brent Bozell, Shane\r\nVander Haart, Manny Roman, Ken Cuccinelli, Dr. James Dobson, the\r\nNational Organization for Marriage, Bob Vander Plaats, Alan\r\nSteinberg, Richard Viguerie, Andrew McCarthy, Ann-Marie Murrell,\r\nTroy Newman, Ginni Thomas, Rep. Steve King, Dr. Michael Brown,\r\nJudge Paul Pressler, former Rep. Bob Barr, Gun Owners of America,\r\nthe National Federation of Republican Assemblies, Ron Robinson,\r\nRep. Jim Bridenstine, and so many more.\r\n        As influential Iowa radio host Steve Deace said in his\r\nendorsement video \"I think [Ted Cruz] is our best chance to\r\npreserve American exceptionalism for the next generation... do\r\nnot wait until the end. Ted Cruz has already put together the\r\nresources, the resume and the organization it takes to move the\r\ncountry back to liberty. Let's get on board now, let's unite now\r\nso that we can take on Washington, D.C. tomorrow.\"\r\n        What the press is saying about our campaign:\r\n        Cruz has Trump, and the rest of the field, beat on\r\norganization. - Politico\r\n        Ted Cruz has assembled an impressive presidential\r\ncampaign structure in Iowa, veteran political observers here say,\r\nwith one going so far as to describe Cruz's campaign as perhaps\r\n\"the most sophisticated\" the first-in-the-nation caucus state has\r\never witnessed. - Cedar Rapids Gazette\r\n        Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is making a\r\nbig bet on building a strong organization outside of the four\r\nearly voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and\r\nNevada. - Nashville Public Radio\r\n        Cruz is widely regarded as the most deeply organized\r\ncandidate in the South, a region that will have outsize influence\r\nin 2016, as many of the states vote on the same day. - Politico\r\n        The Cruz campaign combines a traditional get-out-the-vote\r\noperation - making phone calls and knocking on doors - with\r\nmodern data analytics to identify and mobilize supporters,\r\nbeginning with Iowa on Feb. 1. - Associated Press\r\n        The anti-establishment angst that Cruz stokes may have\r\nleft him isolated in the Senate, but it has also fueled his\r\ncampaign on the road, where he has cultivated an almost cult-like\r\nbase that views him as a lone wolf with the courage to stand up\r\nto Republican Party leaders they believe are no longer fighting\r\nfor them. - Bloomberg\r\n        The months ahead:\r\n        Some campaigns are focused solely on a man, some on a\r\nmovement. Ours is a hybrid of the two built to win. We have\r\nbrought together, and continue to build, a grassroots army of\r\ncourageous conservatives committed to electing Ted Cruz to\r\nreignite the promise of America. Just under a month away from the\r\nstart of the caucuses and primaries we have a network in place\r\nwith the resources required to win that is the envy of every\r\nother campaign. \r\n        There's still plenty of work to be done to make Ted the\r\nRepublican nominee and the next President, but as we begin 2016,\r\nwe are exactly where we want to be. Go. Fight. Win.\r\n        This is OUR time!\r\n        Jeff Roe\r\n        Campaign Manager\r\n        Cruz for President\r\n        P.S.

Throughout the duration of the tour, Ted met with\r\nIowans in many parts of the Hawkeye State often neglected by\r\npresidential candidates. It was a chance for many Iowa families\r\nto hear from a principled leader who shares and fights for their\r\nvalues, and it was an opportunity for them to join the building\r\nmovement in their home state.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            We're seeing\r\nconservatives coalesce around Ted in Iowa and across the nation,\r\nand we continue to work hard to earn every vote. With just a few\r\nshort weeks until the caucuses and primaries begin, hundreds of\r\nthousands of Americans have contributed financially, signed up to\r\nvolunteer, or joined a leadership team or coalition - please help\r\nus grow that number!

"}, {"body": "\r\n\r\nDear Friend,\r\n\r\nYesterday, Louisianans rallied with Ted Cruz for a stronger,\r\nsafer, and infinitely more free America. The Cruz campaign has\r\nbuilt a powerful ground game not just in the first four primary\r\nstates, but in all 24 states that vote before March 15, including\r\nthe Super Tuesday states. It's another signal that conservatives\r\nare inspired by the opportunity to coalesce behind a candidate\r\nwho speaks the truth, who does what he says, and who will be a\r\nvoice for the people. \r\n                                             \r\n                                            \r\n                                             \r\n                                            And today, as\r\nPresident Obama gives his final State of the Union address, it is\r\na reminder that in just a few weeks, we have the choice to vote\r\nfor a change of course -- one that would stop stifling job\r\ncreation and growth, and would instead allow for the creation of\r\nmillions of new jobs; one that would end the assault on\r\nAmericans' rights and champion citizens' God-given liberties; and\r\none that no longer appeases our enemies but stands up to\r\nterrorists and defeats them. That's the kind of change that a\r\nPresident Cruz will bring, and if conservatives unite, it's the\r\nkind of change that will once again give Americans a reason to\r\nbelieve in the promise of America.  \r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                              \r\n                                            \r\n                                            Best,\r\n                                             \r\n                                            Rick Tyler\r\n                                            Communications\r\nDirector\r\n                                            www.tedcruz.org \r\n                                             \r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                            CRUZ NEWS\r\n                                             \r\n                                            \r\n                                            The Advocate: GOP\r\npresidential candidate Ted Cruz visits Baton Rouge supporters\r\n                                             \r\n                                            Texas Tribune: Cruz\r\nCampaign Eyes New Hampshire Opening\r\n                                             \r\n                                            Washington Post:\r\nWeeks from the Iowa caucuses, Cruz trades snow for Southern\r\nsunshine\r\n                                             \r\n                                            Townhall: Ted Cruz\r\nWill Be The GOP Nominee\r\n                                             \r\n                                            The Resurgent: Ben\r\nCarson's Super PAC Staff Just Went Over to Ted Cruz\r\n                                            \r\n                                             \r\n                                            PRESS RELEASES\r\n                                             \r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                            Congressman Sam\r\nJohnson Endorses Ted Cruz for President\r\n                                             \r\n                                            Ted on the Trail:\r\n#CruzinToCaucus Bus Tour Takes Iowa by Storm\r\n                                             \r\n                                            Cruz for President\r\nWins Two GOP Victories in Idaho Over the Weekend\r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                             \r\n                                            VIDEO\r\n                                             \r\n                                            \r\n                                             \r\n                                             \r\n                                             \r\n                                            TWEET\r\n                                             \r\n                                            \r\n                                                                 \r\n                       \r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                            READ and RT: the\r\n#CruzinToCaucus bus tour took Iowa by storm:\r\nhttp://bit.ly/1PU8kur #IACaucus #CruzCrew\r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n                                             \r\n                                            #CruzCrew: tune in to\r\nhear @tedcruz on the @HowieCarrShow today at 4:35 pm ET:\r\nhttp://bit.ly/1mTRWAZ\r\n                                            \r\n                                             \r\n                                            There's still time to\r\nenter to win a custom engraved #CruzCrew shotgun.

As you likely know, the first debate of 2016\r\nwas held on Thursday night in North Charleston. I hope you were\r\nable to watch, but just in case you weren't, you can watch Ted's\r\nresponses to the questions asked here. Following the debate, Ted\r\njoined a focus group of South Carolinians conducted by Frank\r\nLuntz where Luntz asked everyone in attendance who won the debate\r\nand if they thought Ted would beat Hillary in the November\r\ngeneral election. You're going to want to see how they responded!\r\n        That was just Thursday! Earlier in the week, Ted\r\ncompleted a 6 day, 28 county, barnstorming tour through Iowa\r\nwhere he met with thousands of caucus-goers in the Hawkeye State.\r\nYou can get a feel for what the energy was like throughout the\r\n#CruzinToCaucus tour here. After the Iowa tour, Ted continued on\r\nto Louisiana, South Carolina, and New Hampshire where we are\r\ncontinuing the #CruzToVictory bus tour. Find events near you\r\nhere. Additionally, we are in the process of deploying the Strike\r\nForce we implemented to Iowa to help #CruzToVictory in South\r\nCarolina and New Hampshire. If you are interested in being part\r\nof our Strike Force, sign up today to deploy to South Carolina or\r\nNew Hampshire.\r\n        We were also especially glad to announce a very special\r\nendorsement this week. Phil Robertson, a professional hunter,\r\nbusinessman, Christian minister, and reality television star on\r\nthe popular television series Duck Dynasty joined the #CruzCrew!\r\nYou'll want to watch this endorsement video:\r\n        \r\n        This week also saw several new TV ads from the campaign\r\n-- one of them named \"Sovereignty.\" It is airing in South\r\nCarolina and tells the story of when Ted as Solicitor General\r\nfought and won in defense of U.S. sovereignty against the United\r\nNations and the World Court. You can watch the ad here.\r\n        \r\n        We're just 16 days away from the Iowa Caucuses.

The people of the Granite\r\nState know that this election isn't about campaign promises.

some\r\ncandidates have wavered on critical issues, like immigration, the\r\nSecond Amendment, life, and marriage, Ted Cruz has led the fight\r\nin each of those critical battles -- and he continues to do so.\r\nSome people say whatever they can to win -- Ted leads by telling\r\nthe truth. \r\n                                            \r\n                                            \r\n

help me raise the resources to respond immediately to\r\nthese attacks?  \r\n\r\nMy campaign manager tells me we need to raise an additional\r\n$265,000 to respond directly and forcefully to these attacks.\r\nAnd as you know, we are only days away from the first votes being\r\ncast in Iowa.\r\n\r\nI need your immediate contribution to meet this critical need and\r\nto ensure an all-out,

Wade, and our hearts\r\nare heavy as we remember one of the great shadows in our nation's\r\nhistory. More than 56 million children have been denied the\r\nGod-given right to life. We should cherish and defend every life,\r\nespecially the most vulnerable among us.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            On this anniversary,\r\nthousands of families, congregations, and students march for Life\r\nin Washington. It is an incredible testament to the strength of\r\nthe pro-life movement, and Ted Cruz is proud to support them in\r\ntheir tireless fight to protect the sanctity of every life.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            We need a leader in\r\nthe White House who will defund Planned Parenthood, sign\r\nlife-affirming legislation, and promote a culture of life. That\r\nstarts with electing Ted Cruz as our next President -- a leader\r\nwho has defended life at the Supreme Court and always championed\r\nthe precious gift of life.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            And today, as we open\r\nour Greenville, South Carolina, Camp Cruz, it's an opportunity\r\nfor you to volunteer for Ted so that together we can stand for\r\nlife.

We can shock the political\r\nworld with a victory for Ted in Iowa and begin the march to\r\nwinning the Republican nomination and taking back the White\r\nHouse.\r\n        Today in Iowa, Glenn Beck is joining Ted on the campaign\r\ntrail to rally conservative caucus-goers and encourage them to\r\n#CaucusForCruz on February 1. And earlier this week, Ted was in\r\nNew Hampshire where his positive, conservative message resonated\r\nwith voters. As POLITICO wrote, Cruz \"was sparking interest, and\r\nincreasingly, commitments, from voters who stem from the most\r\nconservative wing of the party... there was also a steady flow of\r\npeople who described themselves as conservative, including on\r\nsocial issues, and many said they had decided, or close to it, on\r\nCruz.\"\r\n        Also this week, we saw a tremendous outpouring of support\r\nfrom conservative leaders across the country: Gary Bauer, Steve\r\nStrang, Mike Bickle, Congressman Ken Buck, Reverend CL Bryant,\r\nKentucky Tea Party and conservative leaders, and Eagle Forum\r\nactivists joined the #CruzCrew -- and we'd love to add you to the\r\ngrowing list!\r\n        There's a reason the Washington establishment is fighting\r\nback so fiercely right now. They're afraid. Conservatives are\r\nuniting behind this campaign because in Ted we have a\r\nconservative leader who we all know will change the system in\r\nWashington, break the DC Cartel, and bring power back to We the\r\nPeople. All this is happening because of you. To say thanks for\r\neverything you've done, I wanted you to be one of the first to\r\nsee our latest ad -- just completed today -- before it has aired\r\nanywhere -- click here to watch it now.\r\n        \r\n        Our nation is facing great challenges, but together, we\r\nwill ensure the best days for America are still ahead of us. We\r\nwill ensure a brighter future for our children and grandchildren,\r\nand I'm convinced that with your help we will elect Ted as our\r\nnext president to do exactly that.\r\n        We're just days away from the Iowa Caucuses, and the\r\npolls show this will be a close race. Everything we do between\r\nnow and February 1st will have an enormous impact, so it's all\r\nhands on deck! If you haven't yet, please click here to volunteer\r\nwith the campaign so we can get you plugged in right away. If\r\nyou've already signed up, thank you, please forward this email to\r\nten friends and ask them to do the same right now.\r\n        When Ted wins the Republican nomination, it will be\r\nbecause of your hard work.

Reigniting the Promise of America\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        Hello Friend,\r\n        When we launched this campaign on March 23rd, they said\r\nwe were crazy. The Washington Establishment, the media, and the\r\npolitical chattering class said it was impossible -- that Ted\r\ncould never win. But here we are. Ted is polling second in the\r\nnation, and we're in a dead heat in the Iowa caucuses tomorrow.\r\n        \r\n        In advance of caucus day Monday, I want to reflect back\r\non what we've accomplished together. We have an organization that\r\nis truly second to none. We've raised more money than any other\r\nRepublican in the race. We have a sophisticated data and\r\nanalytics operation that is allowing us to efficiently target\r\nvoters. We have endorsements from some of the most prominent\r\nconservative leaders in the nation. Over 200,000 of you have\r\nsigned up to volunteer with the campaign (over 12,000 in Iowa\r\nalone). Over 700,000 of you have contributed financially to make\r\nthis all possible.\r\n        Poll after poll indicates this is a two person race.\r\nWe're neck and neck for the lead, and what we do between now and\r\ntomorrow can push us over the finish line for a first place\r\nfinish. Even more astonishing is the position in which we find\r\nourselves just ahead of the first in the nation caucus\r\nconsidering the long odds we faced at the beginning.\r\n        Seeking the Republican nomination this year are the two\r\nmost recent winners of the Iowa caucuses. Both Mick Huckabee and\r\nRick Santorum find themselves in the low single digits. Scott\r\nWalker, Rick Perry, and Bobby Jindal all have extremely\r\naccomplished records as governors in their home states and are\r\nsome of the best retail politicians in America. They're no longer\r\nin this race, and this week, we were proud to announce the\r\nendorsement of Gov. Rick Perry and have him join us on the\r\ncampaign trail in Iowa.\r\n        We have opponents in this race with incredible\r\nfundraising networks who have unleashed attack after attack\r\nagainst Ted. We've faced an assault from their well-financed\r\nsuper PACs as well. The ethanol lobby -- which is highly\r\ninfluential in the state of Iowa -- is coming after Ted because\r\nhe doesn't believe Washington politicians should be picking\r\nwinners and losers in the energy sector and handing out special\r\nsubsidies to one industry or another. In total, we've absorbed\r\nover $8 million in attack ads.\r\n        The long odds we faced from the very beginning make our\r\ncurrent position even more impressive. We had a mountain to climb\r\nunlike anyone in recent political history. We're in a strong\r\nposition to reach the peak.\r\n        Why? Because in Ted, the American people see a principled\r\nconservative leader who will tell them the truth, and who does\r\nwhat he says he will do. Now it's up to us to turn out and win!\r\n        \r\n        Let's shock the political world again tomorrow. If the\r\nCruz Crew turns out to caucus, we win. It's that simple. If\r\nyou're in Iowa and want to know how to #CaucusForCruz, our\r\ncampaign put together this instructional video -- click here to\r\nwatch it now. And if you're ready to caucus, please click here to\r\nshare it with your friends!\r\n        I can't thank you enough for everything you've helped us\r\naccomplish so far. Now let's go win the Iowa caucuses --\r\ntogether.

A record number of\r\nIowans showed up to make their voices heard, and that they did!\r\nTed received more votes on Monday than any other Republican\r\ncandidate in caucus history! If you haven't yet, you'll want to\r\nhear what he said at the victory speech.\r\n        \r\n        In addition to a victory for Ted, Monday night was a\r\nvictory for the grassroots, for the millions of conservatives\r\nacross the country who are rising up to take our country back. It\r\nwas a victory for working men and women who have shouldered the\r\nbrunt of the over eight years of out-of-control spending by the\r\nWashington establishment. It was a victory for every American who\r\nbelieves a new day is coming for this nation. And even more than\r\neverything else, it was victory for YOU. It's because of you we\r\ndid what almost everyone said was impossible. We took on the past\r\ntwo caucus winners, the media, the Washington Establishment, the\r\npowerful ethanol lobby, the sitting governor, and more -- and we\r\nwon! \r\n        Not taking a moment to rest, Ted immediately flew to New\r\nHampshire and South Carolina where we saw an outpouring of\r\nenthusiasm for our campaign from people of all walks of life. In\r\nGreenville, SC, the night after the caucus, Ted was greeted by\r\nover 1,000 supporters! And you didn't stop there. In just the\r\nthree days following the caucus, our campaign raised over $3\r\nmillion from over 182,000 contributions averaging $55.00, for a\r\ntotal of $10 million raised since January first!\r\n        Following Iowa, we have a model that we know works, and\r\nwe're going to take it across the country. As we did in Iowa, we\r\nhave opened a Camp Cruz in both New Hampshire and South Carolina\r\nand courageous conservatives from all across the country are\r\nsacrificing their time and talent to help Ted #CruzToVictory! If\r\nyou haven't joined the over 200,000 Americans who have signed up\r\nas a volunteer, don't wait -- we need your help! Sign up today. \r\n        At last night's ABC News Republican Debate, Ted made his\r\nclosing argument to New Hampshirites before they head to the\r\npolls on Tuesday. He made clear his commitment to turning this\r\ncountry around by getting back to the Constitution and the\r\nprinciples that made our country great. He also pledged to always\r\nstand with the American people against the bipartisan corruption\r\nof Washington -- something he has a proven record of doing his\r\nentire life. You can watch that and more here.\r\n        \r\n        We shocked the nation on Monday, and that won't be the\r\nlast time we do so. Whether you're in New Hampshire, South\r\nCarolina, or anywhere else, get ready to #ChooseCruz at the\r\nballot box! With your help and the help of millions of Americans\r\nrising up across the nation, we will elect Ted as our next\r\npresident!\r\n        To victory,\r\n        Jeff Roe\r\n        Campaign Manager\r\n        Cruz for President\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        Press Clips\r\n        \r\n        Huge crowd braves storm for Cruz\r\n        Eagle-Tribune\r\n        \r\n        NH Poll: Donald Trump Flat, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz\r\ngaining\r\n        Breitbart\r\n        \r\n        Ted Cruz has Raised $3 Million Since Iowa Caucus\r\n        Breitbart\r\n        \r\n        Newsboys Lead Singer Michael Tait Endorses Ted Cruz\r\n        The Blaze\r\n        \r\n        Forces Align to Assault the First Hispanic-American to\r\nWin a Presidential Primary\r\n        Rush Limbaugh\r\n        \r\n        BOOM!

I hope you will take a\r\nmoment to read it.\r\n\r\nIf you are like me, you are probably getting a little tired of\r\nall the noise and media frenzy around this campaign. The personal\r\nattacks and outright false claims are staggering. \r\nThere is so much misleading information flying around on cable\r\nTV, the internet and the so-called \"mainstream\" media -- it's\r\nenough to make good people abandon this process and just turn it\r\noff altogether.\r\n\r\nBut, Friend, despite how frustrating this process is -- it is of\r\ncritical importance. I will never give up fighting for Americans\r\nand working to win this campaign because so much is on the line.\r\n\r\nI hope and pray you won't give up either.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I'm so committed to winning this campaign I want to make\r\nyou a personal commitment today (and in a second I'm going to ask\r\nyou to make a commitment in return).\r\n\r\nFirst, my commitment to you:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will always be a consistent conservative -- both in word and\r\ndeed. You will never have to worry about me caving to the\r\nWashington establishment.\r\nI will always shoot straight with you. I will tell the truth.  I\r\nwill apologize when I make a mistake.\r\nI will run an honorable campaign. I will discuss the difference\r\nbetween candidates, but I will not engage in personal negative\r\nattacks.  And when I'm personally attacked, I will not respond in\r\nkind with vicious below-the-belt revenge attacks.\r\nI will be a good steward of your support and financial investment\r\nin me. I want you to know your support is faithfully used.\r\nI will work as hard as I can, make personal and professional\r\nsacrifices to win this campaign, and reignite liberty in our\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nI don't make these commitments lightly. They are my heartfelt\r\nvows to you.\r\n\r\nIf you accept these commitments as my open pledge to you, then\r\nI'm hoping you will make a commitment to me as well.\r\n\r\nYour commitment would mean a great deal to me, as I am just  days\r\naway from the votes being cast in South Carolina, and the stakes\r\nare incredibly high.\r\n\r\n\r\nYES, I COMMIT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly Friend, to win this campaign, I'm going to need your\r\ncommitment because I cannot do it alone.\r\nThat's why I hope you will make the following commitment to me:\r\n\r\n\r\nCommit to pray. In the words of our savior Jesus Christ, where\r\ntwo or more gather, He is there. And while I am blessed with an\r\nincredible prayer team, I hope I can count on your prayers as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nCommit to vote. No matter which state you live in, your vote will\r\nhave the power to help shape this country, and I hope you will\r\ncommit to vote for me.\r\n\r\nCommit to support to this campaign and make an important donation\r\nwhen I need it most.\r\n\r\nOur campaign is coming up against the most brutal opposition only\r\ndays before the next primary votes are to be cast, and to\r\novercome it, I need the renewed commitment of each and every\r\nsupporter of my campaign -- no matter the size.\r\n\r\n\r\nYES, I COMMIT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriend, thank you for taking the time to read my rather lengthy\r\nemail. And thank you for considering making a commitment to my\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is our time, and together we can reignite liberty across\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nHeidi and I are forever grateful for you support.\r\n\r\nFor liberty,\r\n\r\nTed Cruz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAID FOR BY CRUZ FOR PRESIDENTwww.tedcruz.org\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 All Rights Reserved | Privacy Policy\r\n\r\nThis message was intended for: 98xjsmith@gmail.com\r\nYou were added to the system January 2, 2016.\r\nFor more information please follow the URL below:\r\nhttp://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/p/isBi5y1CNN\r\n\r\nFollow the URL below to update your preferences or opt-out:\r\nhttp://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/p/osBi5y1CNN\r\n\r\nTo unsubscribe from future mailings, send an email to mailto:unsub-32622727516-echo3-9A35E927A71D34DF61EAE6DA462E7444@emailsendr.net?Subject=Unsubscribe&body=Please%20remove%20me%20from%20further%20mailings\r\nwith \"Unsubscribe\" as the subject line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "date": "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 11:20:13 -0800", "subject": "Read this  "}, {"body": "\r\n\r\nTed Cruz is now leading Donald Trump nationally.

Number one, it's clear there is only one strong\r\nconservative in this race who can win. And number two, for anyone\r\nwho believes that Donald Trump is not the right candidate to take\r\non Hillary Clinton in November, our campaign is the only campaign\r\nthat has beaten Donald Trump and can beat Donald Trump.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            \r\n                                             \r\n                                            History has shown\r\nthat in order to win the Republican nomination, a candidate must\r\nwin one of the first three states. There are only two candidates\r\nwho have done so - Donald Trump and me. And 70% of Republicans\r\ndon't believe Donald is the right candidate to take on Hillary\r\nClinton in November. Now it is up to us to ensure we elect the\r\nstrongest conservative who can defeat Hillary.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            From the very\r\nbeginning of this campaign, our goal was to do well in the first\r\nfour primary states and then go on to compete and win in the \"SEC\r\nPrimary\" states on Super Tuesday. Because of you, we're\r\naccomplishing the first half of that goal, but now we're headed\r\ninto phase two.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            As we take our\r\ncampaign into Nevada and Super Tuesday, we're in a great\r\nposition. We're in second place in the delegate count with a huge\r\nnumber of delegates up for grabs on March 1st. Over 200,000\r\ncourageous conservatives across the nation have signed up to\r\nvolunteer with our campaign, and we are organized in all 56\r\nstates, territories, and the District of Columbia that send\r\ndelegates to the convention.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            I want to thank you\r\nfor everything you've done so far. We wouldn't be where we are\r\ntoday without your help, but we still have a long way to go.\r\nWe're in this for the long haul, and fighting alongside We the\r\nPeople, we are going to win.

you.\r\n\r\n I need to ask you for a personal favor -- even though it may\r\ncome at great personal expense. \r\nWith only hours before tonight's GOP debate -- and just a few\r\ndays before Super Tuesday (the most important Primary day in the\r\nentire campaign) -- I need your help now more than ever.\r\n\r\nI'm going to do my part tonight -- win the debate -- and show all\r\nof America that I'm the one candidate who will defeat Donald\r\nTrump, who will defeat Hillary Clinton, and who will reverse the\r\nyears of destruction from Obama -- restoring our country to its\r\nfounding, conservative principles.\r\n\r\nBut I really need you to do your part too...\r\n\r\nYou see: my campaign faces its biggest challenge in only a few\r\ndays on Super Tuesday, and we can win if I have the resources.\r\n\r\nBut as of this morning, I am $789,300 short of what I need for my\r\nSUPER TUESDAY VICTORY FUND.\r\nWill you do your part right now -- before tonight's debate -- by\r\nmaking a $35, $50 or $100 special gift?\r\nI hope you know me well enough by now to know that I wouldn't ask\r\nif it weren't vitally important and that I wouldn't ask you this\r\nfavor if I wasn't willing to make the same deep sacrifices\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nPlease let me briefly explain because I'm running out of time.\r\n\r\nRunning for President of the United States has been a HUGE\r\nsacrifice with relentless attacks coming from all sides.\r\n\r\nOnly by the grace of God Almighty, the prayers of my friends and\r\nfamily (my dad is a prayer warrior!), and the continued support\r\nof people just like you have I been able to forge ahead.\r\n\r\nFriend, it's a war I fight daily and a responsibility I don't\r\ntake lightly. \r\n\r\nBut, if I'm being honest, I must share something with you...every\r\ntime we have a victory for the campaign or see a bump in the\r\npolls -- the negative attacks double or even triple against us.\r\n\r\nBetween Donald Trump, the liberal media, and the Washington\r\nCartel, there is not one moment where two or all three are not\r\nsavagely attacking me -- and by extension of our shared\r\nconservative values, YOU. \r\nBut Friend, no matter how hard they try to drag my name through\r\nthe mud, I will not give in to them.\r\n\r\nYou  see: the sacrifices I'm making for our campaign are steep,\r\nand I'm proud and even honored to be making them on your behalf.\r\n\r\nBut now, I really need you to make your own personal sacrifice\r\nfor this campaign -- click here to make a special sacrificial\r\ndonation of $35, $50, or even $10 if you can manage it. \r\nTo make it as quick and easy as possible, I've asked my team to\r\nput together the secure links below so you can make an instant,\r\nsecure gift to support me when I need it most:\r\n\r\nI WILL HELP WITH $5 FOR THE SUPER TUESDAY FUND >>>\r\n \r\nI WILL HELP WITH $35 FOR THE SUPER TUESDAY FUND >>>\r\n\r\n\r\nI WILL HELP WITH $100 FOR THE SUPER TUESDAY FUND >>>\r\n\r\nI

Two minutes into the first quarter, Donald Trump has\r\nthe delegate lead, and Ted Cruz is in second place.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            The media may cover\r\nit like it's over, but there's still a lot of time left.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            After Super Tuesday,\r\nwe'll have completed the first quarter, and it will be more\r\nobvious than ever that there are only two candidates with a path\r\nthe Republican nomination -- Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            The coalition of\r\nvoters we have put together is not going to support an\r\nestablishment candidate such as Marco Rubio. He led the Gang of\r\nEight and the fight to pass amnesty despite telling voters he\r\nopposed amnesty in his 2010 run for the Senate.

So, I must\r\nturn to you for immediate financial help at this critical moment.\r\n\r\nI know I've asked a lot of you over the last few days...and I\r\ndidn't want to have to do this, but I must ask one more time for\r\nyour support of $35 or whatever you can afford.\r\nThere is good news: we are within striking distance of Trump in\r\nseveral key Super Tuesday states -- and we lead in Texas.\r\n \r\n But we cannot afford to let up just hours short of two of the\r\nBIGGEST deadlines for our campaign.\r\n I understand that money is tight and that you can't make up the\r\nwhole shortfall, but can I count on you to make a special,\r\nEMERGENCY contribution of $50, $35, or even $5?\r\nI need you to make sure that our hard work and the hard work of\r\nall our dedicated volunteers is not wasted on March 1st.\r\n\r\n        \r\n        For liberty,\r\n        \r\n        Ted Cruz\r\n        \r\nP.S.

Following Super\r\nSaturday last weekend, the Washington Post wrote the \"results\r\nshow Rubio collapsing, Trump stoppable and Cruz gaining\r\nmomentum.\"\r\n        The voters are now faced with a simple choice: who do you\r\nwant to be our Republican nominee and next President? Do you want\r\nsomeone who has, like Donald Trump for decades, been part of the\r\nproblem in Washington by donating to politicians like Jimmy\r\nCarter, Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid, John Kerry, and Hillary\r\nClinton to benefit him and his business dealings? Or do you want\r\nyour next president to be someone who, like Ted Cruz, has spent a\r\nlifetime defending our Constitution and Bill of Rights?\r\n        As a result of this simple reality, the theme that\r\npermeated throughout the week was unity as we saw conservative\r\nleaders across the country unite behind Ted Cruz. We were proud\r\nto announce the endorsements of Carly Fiorina, U.S. Sen. Mike\r\nLee, Mark Levin, Erick Erickson, Ben Ferguson, and National\r\nReview!\r\n        \r\n        The reason they are all supporting Ted is very simple: he\r\nis the only candidate with a credible path to defeating Donald\r\nTrump at the ballot box -- not placing all his hopes on a\r\ncontested convention -- and he has spent his entire life\r\ndefending our Constitution and Bill of Rights. The stakes of this\r\nelection are simply too high to take a chance with Donald Trump.\r\n        Five more states head to the ballot box this Tuesday:\r\nFlorida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio. If you\r\nlive in one of those states, you can find information about your\r\npolling place and commit to vote for Ted here. Then once you've\r\ndone that, please take the time to reach out to your family,\r\nfriends, and neighbors and encourage them to do the same. And if\r\nyou don't live in one of these five states, we still need your\r\nhelp. Odds are you may know some people who do live in Florida,\r\nIllinois, Missouri, North Carolina, or Ohio -- please pick up the\r\nphone and call them. Explain to them the stakes of this election\r\nand encourage them to 1) commit to vote for Ted and 2) commit to\r\nbringing 9 other people with them to do the same.\r\n        If you know of any people who might need additional\r\nconvincing before Tuesday, Ted participated in a townhall with\r\nMegyn Kelly in Raleigh, North Carolina, earlier this week, that\r\nI'd encourage you to share with everyone you know.\r\n        \r\n        So to conclude this week, I want to ask you a favor.\r\nPlease reach out to everyone you know -- including those who may\r\nbe supporting other candidates. And please make the case to them\r\nthat if they truly believe that Donald Trump is not the right\r\nperson to take on Hillary Clinton in the fall, that there is only\r\none candidate with a shot to beat him, and that is Ted Cruz.

Compare that to the\r\nresults of President Obama's agenda: in the same timeframe, the\r\nnumber of people nationwide who are out of the workforce has\r\nincreased by 8 percent - that means even more people from coast\r\nto coast have given up even looking for jobs.\r\n                                             \r\n                                            But we know how to\r\nchange course - we enact a nationwide plan similar to Governor\r\nWalker's. We lower taxes, break up the big business union bosses,\r\nundo the job-crushing regulations, and let the people create new\r\njobs and build up their communities. We know what works; we just\r\nneed a president with the will to get it done - and Ted Cruz has\r\nproven that he'll fight every day for working men and women so\r\nthat every family can achieve the

And Friend, by extension of our shared\r\nconservative values, they're attacking YOU too. \r\n\r\nRest assured -- no matter how hard they try to drag my name\r\nthrough the mud, I will not give in to them. \r\n\r\nBut now, I really need you to make your own personal sacrifice\r\nfor this campaign -- click here to make a special sacrificial\r\ndonation of $35, $50, or even $10 if you can afford it.\r\n\r\nYou see: the sacrifices I'm making for our campaign are deep and\r\npersonal. I'm proud and even honored to be making them on your\r\nbehalf, but today, before the most important deadline that we\r\nface at MIDNIGHT, I need to hear back from you personally.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make it as quick and easy as possible for you to respond, I've\r\nasked my team to put together the secure links below.\r\n\r\nYou can use them to make an instant, secure gift to support me\r\nwhen I need it most: \r\n\r\nI WILL HELP WITH $3 BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>>\r\n\r\nI WILL HELP WITH $35 BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>> \r\n\r\nI WILL HELP WITH $100 BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>> \r\n\r\nI WILL HELP WITH $250 BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>> \r\n\r\nI WILL HELP WITH $1000 BEFORE MIDNIGHT >>> \r\nPlease, time is critical. \r\n\r\nFriend, I hope to hear back from you before tonight's deadline\r\npasses. \r\n\r\n        \r\n        For liberty,\r\n        \r\n        Ted Cruz                    \r\n                    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n               \t\r\n                   \t\r\n                       \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPAID FOR BY CRUZ FOR PRESIDENTwww.tedcruz.org\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n           Copyright \u00a9 2016 All Rights Reserved | Privacy Policy\r\n\r\nThis message was intended for: 98xjsmith@gmail.com\r\nYou were added to the system January 2, 2016.\r\nFor more information please follow the URL below:\r\nhttp://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/p/isI2gnnCNK\r\n\r\nFollow the URL below to update your preferences or opt-out:\r\nhttp://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/p/osI2gnnCNK\r\n\r\nTo unsubscribe from future mailings, send an email to mailto:unsub-33746315826-echo3-5CF5AD1D4DF7AC4A28BA7961A5C73BE3@emailsendr.net?Subject=Unsubscribe&body=Please%20remove%20me%20from%20further%20mailings\r\nwith \"Unsubscribe\" as the subject line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "date": "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 07:56:31 -0700", "subject": "(no subject)  "}, {"body": "\r\n\r\nCruz For President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriend, we're very close.

The national media that is\r\nmostly based out of New York pretends they don't understand what\r\nNew York Values are. Liberal New York politicians pretend to be\r\noutraged. But everyone knows what this is about. It's about\r\nelecting a president who shares our conservative values.\r\n                                            \r\nThat's why Donald Trump has done everything possible to change\r\nthe subject because he doesn't want you to know about the Real\r\nDonald Trump. Before he was a presidential candidate, the Real\r\nDonald Trump talked about New York Values in his own words and\r\nhow they shaped his views on gay marriage and life. In fact, he\r\nadmitted then that if he were president he would not even ban\r\npartial-birth abortions. \r\n\r\nWatch this NBC News video with the late Tim Russert where the\r\nReal Donald Trump discusses how his views were shaped by growing\r\nup in New York City. He says that New York \"views\" and\r\n\"attitudes\" are different than other places in the country, such\r\nas Iowa. We agree with the Real Donald Trump:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHAHKGP10yc\r\n\r\nAs Donald Trump admits, his New York values are different from\r\nthe values of most of America. After watching the video yourself,\r\nplease share it with your family, friends and neighbors so they\r\ncan see this for themselves.\r\n\r\nAlso, check out this Yahoo News story that explains why the Real\r\nDonald Trump does not want you to see the video. Share that too.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, we have a chance to elect a Real Conservative who shares\r\nour values. That's Ted Cruz.\r\n\r\nThank you for all you do.\r\n\r\nMark Campbell\r\nNational Political Director\r\nCruz for President\r\n\r\nPAID FOR BY CRUZ FOR PRESIDENT\r\nwww.tedcruz.org\r\n\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 All Rights Reserved | Privacy Policy\r\n\r\nThis message was intended for: 98xjsmith@gmail.com\r\nYou were added to the system January 2, 2016.\r\nFor more information please follow the URL below:\r\nhttp://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/p/iWy_c4xy_N\r\n\r\nFollow the URL below to update your preferences or opt-out:\r\nhttp://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/p/oWy_c4xy_N\r\n\r\nTo unsubscribe from future mailings, send an email to mailto:unsub-31839795613-echo3-85BAB89E7110AE62DB2B1C6296309532@emailsendr.net?Subject=Unsubscribe&body=Please%20remove%20me%20from%20further%20mailings\r\nwith \"Unsubscribe\" as the subject line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "date": "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 05:51:26 -0800", "subject": "WATCH: Donald Trump's New York Values -- In His Own Words  "}]}

No one imagined thi=\r\ns campaign would have the indomitable strength and spirit that we've had ov=\r\ner the last nine months. No one but you.\r\n\r\nAnd this race is just beginning.\r\n\r\nOn Monday night, we outperformed everyone's expectations. We beat two big n=\r\name governors-John Kasich and Chris Christie-and we beat th=\r\ne last two winners of the Iowa caucuses. We tied for delegates with two dee=\r\np-pocketed favorites: Jeb Bush and Rand Paul.\r\n\r\nOur goal has always been: defy expectations, and move on to the next fight.=\r\n Unlike my opponents who bet big on Iowa or New Hampshire, our campaign has=\r\n never been staked on just one state, or one primary, or one day.\r\n\r\nWe've built a campaign that's strong in all 50 states. We've built a campai=\r\ngn that can run a marathon, not a sprint. We're in this fight for the long =\r\nhaul.\r\n\r\nWhen we started back in May, I was 17 out of 16: no one even asked my name =\r\nin polls. The pundits who did talk about me said I wouldn't last long.\r\n\r\nThey underestimated us even after we won the first debate and the second de=\r\nbate. They underestimated us even when we outlasted the biggest names in po=\r\nlitics, as Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry, George Patak=\r\ni, Bobby Jindal, and Lindsey Graham each faltered.\r\n\r\nBut if there's one thing you learn as a woman entering corporate business i=\r\nn the 1970s, it's that being told \"no\" cannot make you give up. It cannot r=\r\nender you silent. It cannot make you feel powerless, or afraid, or intimida=\r\nted.\r\n\r\nInstead, the word \"no\" must give you the strength to reject the status quo.=\r\n It must instill in you the courage to speak out against the powerful. And =\r\nit must fill you with the resolve to continue to fight, no matter what the =\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nToday, that's exactly what I intend to keep doing in this race.\r\n\r\nThe pundits will continue to underestimate me moving forward. And they will=\r\n continue to underestimate you, too. They want you to believe this race has=\r\n already been decided for you, by just one state's voters. They want you to=\r\n believe that your voice and your opinion is now meaningless and without va=\r\nlue.\r\n\r\nThey want you to believe that there are only three people left in this race=\r\n: a reality TV star who's gone bankrupt four times, and two career politici=\r\nans who will say anything to win themselves a bigger office and a better ti=\r\ntle.\r\n\r\nJust like they always do, the pundits and the political class have it wrong=\r\n. Your voice still matters. Your strength and resolve in this fight still m=\r\natters. And we can still solve our nation's problems: with leadership, with=\r\n integrity, and with the backbone to keep on fighting.\r\n\r\nMy commitment to you remains the same as it's always been: I will not falte=\r\nr. I will not give up. And I will not stop fighting until the citizens of a=\r\nll 50 states have made our voices heard.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for fighting alongside me.

This=\r\n campaign has the same number of delegates as Governors Bush and Kasich whi=\r\nle Governor Christie has zero. We're ahead of Dr. Carson in New Hampshire p=\r\nolling. We are 6th in hard dollars raised and have twice the cash on hand a=\r\ns either Governors Christie or Kasich. We are already on the ballot in 32 s=\r\ntates, and there is a ground game with paid staff in 12 states. Yet, all of=\r\n these candidates will be invited to the ABC debate.

For standing with me, for fighting with me. For your gene=\r\nrosity, for your support, and for your faith. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThis campaign was always about citizenship-taking back our country =\r\nfrom a political class that only serves the big, the powerful, the wealthy,=\r\n and the well connected. Election after election, the same empty promises a=\r\nre made and the same poll-tested stump speeches are given, but nothing chan=\r\nges. I've said throughout this campaign that I will not sit down and be qui=\r\net. I'm not going to start now. While I suspend my candidacy today, I will =\r\ncontinue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to=\r\n settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for th=\r\nem.\r\n\r\nOur Republican Party must fight alongside these Americans as well. We must =\r\nend crony capitalism by fighting the policies that allow it to flourish. We=\r\n must fix our festering problems by holding our bloated, inept government b=\r\nureaucracy accountable. Republicans must stand for conservative principles =\r\nthat lift people up and recognize all Americans have the right to fulfill t=\r\nheir God-given potential.\r\n\r\nTo young girls and women across the country, I say: do not let others defin=\r\ne you. Do not listen to anyone who says you have to vote a certain way or f=\r\nor a certain candidate because you're a woman. That is not feminism. Femini=\r\nsm doesn't shut down conversations or threaten women. It is not about ideol=\r\nogy. It is not a weapon to wield against your political opponent. A feminis=\r\nt is a woman who lives the life she chooses and uses all her God-given gift=\r\ns. And always remember that a leader is not born, but made. Choose leadersh=\r\nip.\r\n\r\nAs I have said to the many wonderful Americans I have met throughout this c=\r\nampaign, a leader is a servant whose highest calling is to unlock potential=\r\n in others.\r\n\r\nI will continue to serve in order to restore citizen government to this gre=\r\nat nation so that together we may fulfill our potential.\r\n\r\nThank you again for all you've made possible.\r\n\r\nCarly\r\n\r\nPAID FOR BY CARLY FOR PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe: http://carlyforpresident.msgfocus.com/u/127TRHiLn4p2CW\r\n", "date": "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 21:49:37 +0000", "subject": "Thank you"}, {"body": "John,\r\n\r\nLast Tuesday, Virginia had a primary-and even though my own name wa=\r\ns on the ballot, I checked the box for Ted Cruz.\r\n\r\nWhen Republicans lost the last Presidential election, the Republican establ=\r\nishment thought it knew just what to do.

In the meantime, I\r\nhope you'll also follow me on Facebook\r\n<https://www.facebook.com/CarlyFiorina?cs-from=149815f0-62cd-4a3b-bb7d-f47bef131313>--so\r\nyou'll always know what we're up to, in real time.\r\n\r\n I couldn't be more excited to be running for President. Because, like you,\r\nI know that it's time for actual leadership in Washington.\r\n\r\n We've had years of empty talk, career politicians, identity politics, and\r\npartisan finger pointing.\r\n\r\n And it hasn't worked.\r\n\r\n What we need is a President who has vision, leadership, and principles. A\r\nPresident who can deliver the tangible results America needs now and for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n With your help, I hope to be that President.\r\n\r\n Thank you again for your support, and I look forward to having you along\r\nfor the ride to the White House.\r\n\r\n Best,\r\n Carly\r\n<https://www.facebook.com/CarlyFiorina?cs-from=149815f0-62cd-4a3b-bb7d-f47bef131313>\r\n<https://twitter.com/CarlyFiorina?cs-from=149815f0-62cd-4a3b-bb7d-f47bef131313>\r\n                          PAID FOR BY CARLY FOR PRESIDENT \r\n            \r\n     Unsubscribe\r\n<https://app.crowdskout.com/email/un/149815f0-62cd-4a3b-bb7d-f47bef131313?cs-from=149815f0-62cd-4a3b-bb7d-f47bef131313>\r\n   Carly for President.

Other candidates and their allies have spent $30 to\r\n$80 million more than Kasich - including millions attacking him -\r\nbut have little or nothing to show for it.  Gov. Kasich's\r\ncommitment to a positive, inclusive, forward-looking approach and\r\nvision for our country is connecting with voters despite the\r\ngreater resources of his rivals and their negative attacks.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n                 \r\n        Huge Crowds in Michigan, Massachusetts & Vermont:\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        While campaigning this week in Michigan, South Carolina,\r\nMassachusetts and Vermont, our crowd sizes continue to grow as\r\nmore Americans have the opportunity to hear John Kasich's\r\npositive message for America.

This poll is the eighth in the series and\r\nincludes responses from 701 of the 4,078 IR scholars currently\r\nteaching and/or researching at colleges and universities\r\nthroughout the United States.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        At 54 percent, the majority of scholars chose Ohio\r\nGovernor John Kasich, followed by former Florida Governor Jeb\r\nBush, who garnered the support of just under 30 percent of\r\nrespondents. Interestingly, no other Republican candidate broke\r\nout of single digits with IR scholars. Despite strong support in\r\nnational and state public opinion polls, just 1.7 percent of IR\r\nscholars selected real estate mogul Donald Trump, while 1.5\r\npercent selected Sen. Ted Cruz.

most\r\ndelegates emerge as the nominee?\r\n                                \r\n                                Why? \r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                                Because the convention is a\r\ncontinuation of the primary process and when no candidate has\r\nreached the number, it's an opportunity for delegates to choose\r\nwho is the

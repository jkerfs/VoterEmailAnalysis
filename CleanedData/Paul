Hillary Clinton? We know how that movie\r\nends... trillions more in debt, more taxes, and more Benghazis.\r\nRadical Islam thrived and grew while Hillary was on the top floor\r\nof the state department. Now she wants a promotion? \r\n\r\nThe elites that run the Washington machine at our expense will\r\nthrow everything against us. \r\n\r\nThat's why we need your help today, right now, to help fuel our\r\ncampaign to defeat the Washington machine. \r\n\r\nWill you contribute $25, $50, $100, $250, $1,000, or even the\r\nmaximum $2,700? \r\n\r\nNo amount is too small. The biggest thing we need is you on board\r\ntoday. \r\n\r\nHere's the thing: we're in this race. That means the media,\r\npundits, and the elites will want to know how many people got on\r\nboard. \r\n\r\nOur first quarter's fundraising total very well be the most\r\nimportant of the entire campaign because it will set the tone. \r\n\r\nYou see, the experts say a dollar contributed early on is worth\r\n$2 or $3 later. That's been one of the tricks of the power\r\nbrokers. Hillary will raise gobs of cash out of DC, New York, San\r\nFrancisco, and LA. \r\n\r\nSo we need early support. It's crucial. \r\n\r\nAnd with your support here's my plan to defeat the Washington\r\nmachine and unleash the American Dream: \r\nTerm limits to get rid of the career politicians.\r\nRequire Congress to read legislation before they actually vote on\r\nit - read the bills!\r\nAudit the Fed - we deserve to know what's happening with our\r\nmoney.\r\nPass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution - no more\r\nadding trillions in debt - time to pay it down.\r\nBoldly overhaul the tax code - no more loopholes for the biggest\r\ncorporations with the best lobbyists - give workers a tax cut.\r\nStop Common Core - school choice is the way forward.\r\nAnd on and on and on.\r\nBasically it's the opposite of what Hillary would do. Term\r\nlimits, read the bills, Audit the Fed, cut debt, overhaul the tax\r\ncode, ending Common Core... \r\n\r\n... and I'll take this message to every corner of America. I've\r\nbeen to Detroit. I've been to Ferguson. I've been to Berkeley.\r\nI've been to Chicago. I've been to Howard. Everywhere I go I\r\nbring the conservative message to the young, to those who are\r\nstruggling, to those who the Left has failed... and they respond!\r\n\r\n\r\nOurs is the winning message, but it is one that scares those who\r\nhave profited at our expense. \r\n\r\nSo I'm running for President of the United States. \r\n\r\nI humbly ask you to help us defeat the Washington machine. \r\n\r\nToday - right now - is when I need your help most. \r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\nRand Paul \r\n\r\nSent from my iPad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaid for by Rand Paul for President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message was intended for: 98xjsmith@gmail.com\r\nYou were added to the system January 2, 2016.\r\nFor more information please follow the URL below:\r\nhttp://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/p/iWBdb1zyNP\r\n\r\nFollow the URL below to update your preferences or opt-out:\r\nhttp://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/p/oWBdb1zyNP\r\n\r\nTo unsubscribe from future mailings, send an email to mailto:unsub-31547600733-echo3-81D76649326AB0B10DB446B43FB0A7F3@emailsendr.net?Subject=Unsubscribe&body=Please%20remove%20me%20from%20further%20mailings\r\nwith \"Unsubscribe\" as the subject line.\r\n\r\n\r\n----Powered by Paramount Communication----\r\nhttp://www.paramountcommunication.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "date": "Sun, 03 Jan 2016 06:06:14 -0800", "subject": "re: 2016  "}]}

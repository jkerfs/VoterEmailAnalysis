Eight years ago this week, was the first time many\r\nAmericans heard the name Barack Obama, then a little-known\r\nSenator from Illinois who had won the Iowa caucuses just days\r\nbefore. \r\n \r\nIn Hooksett, New Hampshire yesterday morning, Marco Rubio\r\ndelivered a foreign policy address, and he began his remarks with\r\nthe fact above.\r\n \r\nHe did so to highlight the grave international blunders that\r\nPresident Obama, and Hillary Clinton alongside him, made over the\r\npast eight years, and in contrast, explain why he's the only\r\ncandidate with the experience and strategy to fix their mistakes.\r\n \r\nMarco noted, \"When you vote for me, you know exactly what you'll\r\nget. You'll get a president who will destroy terrorists overseas\r\nby authorizing whatever tools our commanders need. You'll get a\r\nreversal of the defense cuts that Obama and Harry Reid have\r\nforced on our military.\"  \r\n \r\nHe also explained that not every Republican running has made\r\nthese same commitments.\r\n \r\nMarco mentioned further: \"I am also the only candidate to have\r\nlaid out a detailed strategy to roll back our president's\r\nfailures - a strategy to rebuild our military, revitalize our\r\nalliances, defeat ISIS, and restore American leadership to a\r\nworld badly in need of it.\"\r\n \r\nWe cannot afford to place our trust in candidates who flip-flop\r\non policy positions and deny where they've stood on the issues.\r\nWe need a president who has a clear, conservative vision for the\r\nfuture of our nation. Marco Rubio will be that president.\r\n \r\nTo learn more, see Marco's full remarks on MarcoRubio.com\r\nhttp://email.vervemail.com/ct/45674871:6P8BDprNE:m:3:1808198062:5188F2D149FCAC958F0AF30EF0E8AD13:r\r\n \r\nFriend, by supporting Marco you are supporting our strongest and\r\nonly chance to win in 2016 and bring America back.\r\n \r\nPlease take the pledge to support Marco on February 9th.\r\nhttp://email.vervemail.com/ct/45674871:6P8BDprNE:m:3:1808198062:5188F2D149FCAC958F0AF30EF0E8AD13:r\r\n \r\nThank you for reading,\r\n \r\nJonathan Slemrod\r\nPolicy Director\r\nMarco Rubio for President\r\n\r\nThis message was intended for: 98xjsmith@gmail.com \r\n\r\nToo many emails?

This\r\nstarts by joining me at a town hall in Concord on Friday morning.\r\n \r\nAs the 2016 Primary Elections fast approach, there's no better\r\ntime like the start of the New Year to hear my plan for a New\r\nAmerican Century.\r\n \r\nI've been traveling through the Granite State and listening to\r\nthe concerns of voters like you. I've been asked about repealing\r\nObamaCare and a strategy to end drug abuse, how I'd reform the VA\r\nand increase our national security.\r\n \r\nI'll tell you this: I am the only candidate who's damaged\r\nObamaCare by blocking a $2.5 billion ObamaCare bailout fund and I\r\nam the only candidate with the experience and conservative\r\nsolutions necessary to strengthen our foreign policy.\r\n \r\nRemember, in just a few short weeks, voters in early states and\r\nbeyond will be heading to the polls. Bring your friends and\r\nfamily, so that they too can hear our message of smaller\r\ngovernment and free enterprise.\r\n \r\nThe details:\r\n \r\nWhat: Concord Town Hall with Marco Rubio\r\nWhen: 10:30 AM, Friday, January 8th\r\nWhere: Red Blazer Restaurant - 72 Manchester Street Concord, NH\r\n03301\r\n \r\nIf you'd like to attend, click here to confirm.\r\n\r\nwww.eventbrite.com/e/concord-town-hall-with-marco-rubio-tickets-20305334803\r\n \r\nQuestions?

So I wanted to let you know what we're thinking about\r\ntonight, and what Marco's planning for.You've probably noticed\r\nthat the attacks on Marco over the past few weeks -- both from\r\nhis Republican opponents and from Democrats terrified of facing\r\nhim in a general -- have increased dramatically.

Marco has an\r\noptimistic conservative message and vision that no other\r\ncandidate can match, and that's why they have to go on the\r\nattack. In response, Marco isn't going to get personal, but he\r\nwill be drawing distinctions on some important policy questions.\r\nOther candidates are proposing news taxes, have inconsistent\r\npositions on foundational issues like life and the Second\r\nAmendment, or have voted in the past to weaken our military.We're\r\nnot afraid to debate those issues. In fact, we have to, because\r\nwe don't just need a Republican in the White House next year --\r\nwe need a conservative Republican who will undo the damage done\r\nby Barack Obama. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Marco's best-equipped to do that because he's the best candidate\r\nto take on Hillary Clinton (or Bernie!), and because he's spent\r\nyears coming up with the conservative ideas we need to build a\r\nNew American Century. These debates have been great opportunities\r\nto get that message out there, but they're not nearly enough: Our\r\nopponents will spend millions of dollars over the next few weeks\r\nattacking Marco, so please considering going here to make a\r\nDebate Day donation right now.

Friend, we cannot\r\nafford a Hillary Clinton presidency. If you want to see her\r\ndefeated, then you must support my campaign right now. Our\r\nnation's future depends on it. Please follow this link to make an\r\nurgent donation right now. If I don't have your support, I won't\r\nbe able to win the Republican nomination and then our country\r\nwill certainly fall into Hillary's hands. So, Friend, if you're\r\nlike me and are disgusted by her lies, and revolted by the fact\r\nthe media and so many liberals have let her get away with this,\r\nthen you need to stand with me right now. If Hillary Clinton\r\nbecomes president: The Second Amendment will be under relentless\r\nattack, new taxes will inundate our families and small\r\nbusinesses, and our immigration laws will fail to be enforced.\r\nIt's a horrible thought, but one we must consider to ensure the\r\nWhite House does not fall into the wrong hands (again). I will\r\nnever stop fighting for our conservative values and beliefs. I\r\nwill not stoop to the attacks my Republican opponents are\r\nthrowing my way, but in order to win the nomination and defeat\r\nHillary, I need your help. Will you support me and our nation's\r\nfuture right now? Thanks for your commitment to our nation. Marco\r\nRubio P.S. We saw last night that my opponents would rather\r\nbicker with each other than focus and discuss the critical issues\r\nfacing our nation. I am focused on keeping America safe and\r\nprotecting our citizens, but I cannot win this without your\r\nsupport. Please show your commitment to our nation by making a\r\ndonation to our campaign right now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDonate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaid for by Marco Rubio for President\r\n\r\nThis message was intended for: 98xjsmith@gmail.com \r\n\r\nToo many emails?

Our\r\nfamily has traveled across the country, meeting Americans from\r\nevery walk of life and hearing their own American Dream stories\r\nand goals for their lives and their children's. And, Friend,\r\nI've learned and seen a lot from traveling the country and\r\nwatching my husband campaign over the last year. Our great nation\r\nis sitting on the brink of complete disaster. Our economy is\r\nweak, America's values are eroding, and the future of our country\r\nunder our current leadership looks bleak. But, Friend, we have a\r\nrare opportunity this year to change this. We have a chance to\r\nright the wrongs done by President Obama and his Democrat allies\r\nin Congress. But we will only be able to turn our country around\r\nand restore the great values into our nation if we elect my\r\nhusband, Marco Rubio. Marco is the only candidate who has both\r\nthe experience needed and the plans outlined to make real\r\nconservative change from Day One.

You wonder if they will grow up in a\r\nprosperous, free nation with strong values or always live in a\r\ncountry that overtaxes its citizens and restricts their\r\nliberties.

Many are\r\nlooking at the support Marco has, and hopeful to see him\r\ndefeated. In fact, no one would love to see Marco lose more than\r\nHillary Clinton. Marco is the best candidate to defeat Hillary.\r\nBut he cannot defeat her unless he first has your support.\r\nFriend, we cannot afford to jeopardize our future by not acting\r\nin the next 11 months. The actions we take today will impact the\r\noutcome of November's election. If you want to live in a\r\nstronger, more prosperous world that is better for our children,\r\nthen you must support Marco Rubio. On behalf of my family, thank\r\nyou so much for the support you've already shown. Campaigning and\r\npolitics is at times not pretty, but we stay strong knowing we\r\nhave you by our side.

Will you go here to help us meet this critical goal?\r\n \r\nIt's absolutely essential for us to have as much momentum as we\r\ncan going into New Hampshire, and then South Carolina and Nevada.\r\nWe're setting an aggressive goal, but the momentum we have right\r\nnow makes me confident we can hit it.\r\n \r\nI'm excited to get the voting started, because the more voters\r\nsee of Marco, the more they're joining up with us. We just need\r\nto keep hitting our goals. So go here now to make a secure\r\ncontribution.\r\n \r\nFour days, $400,000. We can do it.\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\n \r\nTerry Sullivan\r\nCampaign Manager\r\nMarco Rubio for President\r\n\r\nP.S. Marco's going to work his tail off over the next four days\r\nto succeed in the Iowa caucuses.

I will never\r\nwaver from my goal to connect with every American and take our\r\nnation back, but I can't accomplish that unless I have your\r\nsupport.\r\n \r\nNow is the time to unite our party, rather than spew outrageous\r\nattacks. Real leadership means coming up with commonsense\r\nsolutions -- not mudslinging.\r\n \r\nIf you stand with me, I need to know RIGHT NOW.

I am asking you today to stand with me against these\r\noutlandish attacks and fight for a better future. Together we can\r\nwin the Republican nomination and defeat Hillary Clinton. But I\r\ncan only be successful if I have your support right now.

The\r\nconservative movement today is one where a son of a bartender and\r\na maid can be on the road to being president of the United\r\nStates, where a daughter of Indian immigrants has helped South\r\nCarolina prosper like never before, where a South Carolinian who\r\ngrew up in working poverty can become the first African-American\r\nsenator from the South in more than a century.\r\n \r\nIf you want to be a part of that movement, and help us win this\r\nfall, take the next step with me -- lend your support right now.\r\nhttp://email.vervemail.com/ct/46306455:6r7djfrNY:m:3:1818111541:C678F25C3207C57891745EB86AEB22ED:r\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nMarco Rubio\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, Marco you can count on me!\r\nhttp://email.vervemail.com/ct/46306455:6r7djfrNY:m:3:1818111541:C678F25C3207C57891745EB86AEB22ED:r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaid for by Marco Rubio for President\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to 98xjsmith@gmail.com\r\n          \r\nThis email was sent by: Chris Christie for President, P.O.

I'm immensely proud of what we did these last\r\neleven months, and I'm so grateful for everything supporters like\r\nyou put into it. I know it was a lot, and I appreciate every last\r\nminute and dollar.\r\n \r\nAs I said last night, you are truly the best, hardest working\r\nsupporters anywhere, and I tried my very best to run a campaign\r\nthat was worthy of all of you.\r\n \r\nThat was a campaign that was unflinchingly optimistic, and that\r\nwas all about the ideals and values that have made America\r\nexceptional. Sadly, in this election, that didn't make for a\r\nwinning campaign, but I hope you think it made for a worthy one\r\n-- worthy of our party, our movement, and our country.\r\n \r\nAmericans are really angry, and frustrated, and I share that:\r\nthey have a political establishment that doesn't fight for them,\r\ndoesn't respond to their concerns, and doesn't value what they\r\ndo. I know because I share those values and concerns.\r\n \r\nThe answer to that will be a movement that values free\r\nenterprise, our Constitution, and our Judeo-Christian values,\r\nthat doesn't look down on conservatives, that doesn't manipulate\r\nanger but tries to solve it. When that movement is revived, when\r\nwe have a movement that recognizes the challenges we face but\r\nalso has forward-thinking answers for them, then we will finally\r\nbe on the verge of a New American Century.\r\n \r\nWhile this may not have been the year for a hopeful and\r\noptimistic message, I am as hopeful and optimistic about America\r\nas I have ever been. I don't want Americans to give in to anger,\r\nfrustration, and hate -- we cannot afford it -- and I don't\r\nbelieve they well.\r\n \r\nAs I said in Miami last night, I take great comfort in the\r\nancient words that teach us that in their hearts humans plan\r\ntheir course, but the Lord establishes their steps.\r\n \r\nI truly mean it when I say I have the best supporters in the\r\nworld. It's a great credit to you that you chose not to give in\r\nto anger and frustration, that you want America to remain not\r\njust a rich and powerful nation, but a special one. I'll never\r\ngive up fighting alongside you to make that happen.\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nMarco Rubio\r\nDonate\r\n   \r\nPaid for by Marco Rubio for President\r\n    \r\n\r\nThis message was intended for: 98xjsmith@gmail.com \r\n\r\nToo many emails?

But here it goes.\r\n \r\nI have decided to seek reelection to the United States Senate.\r\n \r\nI understand my opponents will try to use this decision to score\r\npolitical\r\npoints against me. Have at it. Because I have never claimed to be\r\nperfect, or to have all the answers.\r\n \r\nStill, the people of Florida deserve to know why I've changed my\r\nmind.\r\n \r\nI have often said that the U.S. Senate can be a frustrating\r\nplace. And it's true. After witnessing the gridlock that grips\r\nWashington, I think just about every American - Democrat or\r\nRepublican - would agree.\r\n \r\nBut the Senate is also a place from which you can perform great\r\nservices for the people you have the honor of representing. And I\r\nam proud of the work we have done to help thousands of Floridians\r\nover the last six years.  \r\n \r\nThe Senate can also be a place from which great policy advances\r\ncan be made. I am proud that we have done that too.\r\n \r\nBut as we begin the next chapter in the history of our nation,\r\nthere's another role for the Senate that could end up being its\r\nmost important in the years to come: The Constitutional power to\r\nact as a check and balance on the excesses of a president.\r\n \r\nControl of the Senate may very well come down to the race in\r\nFlorida. That means the future of the Supreme Court will be\r\ndetermined by the Florida Senate seat. It means the future of the\r\ndisastrous Iran nuclear deal will be determined by the Florida\r\nSenate seat. It means the direction of our country's fiscal and\r\neconomic policies will be determined by this Senate seat. The\r\nstakes for our nation could not be higher.\r\n \r\nThere's also something else. No matter who is elected president,\r\nthere is reason for worry. \r\n \r\nWith Hillary Clinton, we would have four more years of the same\r\nfailed economic policies that have left us with a stagnant\r\neconomy. We would have four more years of the same failed foreign\r\npolicy that has allowed radical Islam to spread, and terrorists\r\nto be released from Guantanamo. And even worse, if Clinton were\r\npresident and her party took control of Congress, she would\r\ngovern without Congressional oversight or limit. It would be a\r\nrepeat of the early years of the current administration, when we\r\ngot Obamacare, the failed stimulus and a record debt. \r\n \r\nThe prospect of a Trump presidency is also worrisome to me. It is\r\nno secret that I have significant disagreements with Donald\r\nTrump. His positions on many key issues are still unknown. And\r\nsome of his statements, especially about women and minorities, I\r\nfind not just offensive but unacceptable. If he is elected, we\r\nwill need Senators willing to encourage him in the right\r\ndirection, and if necessary, stand up to him. I've proven a\r\nwillingness to do both.\r\n \r\nIn the days ahead, America will continue to face serious\r\nchallenges - the possibility of terrorist attacks at home and\r\nabroad, a declining military, anemic economic growth and low\r\nwages, assaults on our rights and values, outdated health care,\r\neducation and pension programs in desperate need of reform - that\r\nface backward or uncertain responses from either Clinton or\r\nTrump. \r\n \r\nNo matter who wins the White House, we need a strong group of\r\nprincipled, persuasive leaders in Congress who will not only\r\nadvance limited government, free enterprise and a strong national\r\ndefense, but also explain to Americans how it makes life better\r\nfor them and their families. I ultimately changed my mind about\r\nthis race because on that front, and in that fight, I believe I\r\nhave something to offer. \r\n \r\nIn the end, this was a decision made not in Washington, but back\r\nhome in West Miami over Father's Day weekend, with my wife and\r\nour four children.\r\n \r\n\r\nThere were two paths before us. There was one path that was more\r\npersonally comfortable and probably smarter politically.

I ultimately changed my mind about\r\nthis race because on that front, and in that fight, I believe I\r\nhave something to offer. \r\n\r\nI am not taking this campaign lightly.

We have five months to\r\nraise enough money to defeat my opponents who have been\r\nfundraising for a year. \r\n\r\nWill you be a Day One Supporter to my Senate campaign?\r\n\r\nThanks for your commitment to our country.

If my Democratic opponent were to\r\ndefeat me, it would mean a Senate stacked with liberal democrats\r\nlike Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Al Franken, and my opponent. \r\n  \r\nCan you imagine the damage they could and would do to our nation\r\nif they gained control?\r\n  \r\nI need your immediate support to make certain he doesn't defeat\r\nme this fall. Since announcing my campaign just one month ago,\r\nI've seen a lot of support but I'm at a disadvantage. My opponent\r\nhas been running his campaign for over a year and raising money\r\nfor just as long.  But with your support today, we can overcome a\r\nlate start to this race.\r\n \r\nMy opponents have had months to campaign and fundraise for this\r\nrace: I've had a little over a month.   And with our primary\r\nelection in August, we have to play catch-up.\r\n  \r\nIn just 5 days, we will face our last end of month deadline\r\nbefore our August primary election.  With the primary coupled\r\nwith early voting starting soon, there is no time waste.  Can I\r\ncount on your support before the end of July - $25 or even $250\r\nbefore Sunday night?\r\n  \r\nThe fight to keep the Republican Majority in the United States\r\nSenate rests on the backs of Florida voters.  I know this is a\r\nbig responsibility. When I made the decision to run for\r\nre-election, I didn't make it lightly and I knew we would face an\r\nuphill battle.  But, Friend, the important things in life are\r\nhardly easily won...\r\n  \r\nNow is our time to show the strength of our campaign, but I need\r\nyou to continue to build the momentum here.\r\n  \r\nJust 36 days ago, I announced that I was running for re-election.\r\n In little over a month, Team Marco has built the momentum not\r\nonly to win the primary election in August, but also to win in\r\nNovember and keep the Senate Majority in the hands of\r\nconservatives.  \r\n \r\nFriend, I need your support once again before July 2016 comes to\r\na close.  Will you chip in $25, $50, $100, $250 or more before\r\nmidnight this Sunday?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n Marco Rubio\r\n \r\nP.S. I am running for re-election because there is still more\r\nwork to do in the Senate, but if we lose the majority, I cannot\r\nfinish that work. August will be one of the most critical months\r\nin my re-election campaign and I need to make sure we continue to\r\nbuild the momentum needed to win.

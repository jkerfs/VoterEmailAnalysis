While President Obama deserves credit for =\r\ngetting this economy back on track after the Wall Street crash, the =\r\nreality is there is a lot of unfinished business.\r\n\r\nThat's why today in New York City, I announced my plan for taking on Wall =\r\nStreet. We must break up the banks, end their casino-style gambling, and =\r\nfundamentally change the approach of the financial industry to focus on =\r\nhelping the American people.\r\n\r\nWhen I am president, we will reform Wall Street and our financial system =\r\nto make it work for all Americans. I want to tell you about what I will =\r\ndo, then ask you to add your name to endorse our plan:\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/wall-street\r\n\r\nTo those on Wall Street, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact, =\r\nthe greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of =\r\nour nation. And here is a promise I will make as president: If Wall Street =\r\ndoes not end its greed, we will end it for them.\r\n\r\nAs most people know, in the 1990s and later, financial interests spent =\r\nbillions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force =\r\nthrough Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the =\r\nGlass-Steagall Act, and the weakening of consumer protection laws.\r\n\r\nThey paid this money to show the American people all that they could do =\r\nwith that freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, =\r\nthe greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly =\r\ndestroyed the U.S. and global economy. Millions of Americans lost their =\r\njobs, their homes, and their life savings.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is =\r\nincreasing, and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing =\r\nwider and wider by the day. But the American people are catching on. They =\r\nalso know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power =\r\nover the economic and political life of our country.\r\n\r\nWe must act now to change that. Our goal must be to create a financial =\r\nsystem and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of =\r\nbillionaires.\r\n\r\nThere are eight points to my plan, and I want to go through each of them =\r\nhere because I think it's important for our campaign to discuss specific =\r\npolicies with our supporters. Some of this may seem a little in the weeds, =\r\nbut I trust our supporters to be able to handle this kind of policy =\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nHere's my plan for what I will do with Wall Street when I am president:\r\n\r\n- Break up huge financial institutions in the first year of my =\r\nadministration. Within the first 100 days of my administration, I will =\r\nrequire the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a \"Too Big to Fail\" =\r\nlist of commercial banks, shadow banks, and insurance companies whose =\r\nfailure would pose a catastrophic risk to the U.S. economy without a =\r\ntaxpayer bailout. Within one year, my administration will break these =\r\ninstitutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy.\r\n\r\n- Reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate =\r\ntraditional banking from risky investment banking and insurance services. =\r\nIt is not enough to tell Wall Street to \"cut it out,\" propose a few new =\r\nrules and slap on some fines. Under my administration, financial =\r\ninstitutions will no longer be too big to fail or too big to manage. Wall =\r\nStreet cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in =\r\nrisky financial instruments. If an institution is too big to fail, it is =\r\ntoo big to exist.\r\n\r\n- End too-big-to-jail. We live in a country today that has an economy that =\r\nis rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt, and a criminal =\r\njustice system which often does not dispense justice. The average American =\r\nsees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing =\r\nmarijuana. But when it comes to Wall Street executives -- some of the most =\r\nwealthy and powerful people in this country whose illegal behavior hurt =\r\nmillions of Americans -- somehow nothing happens to them. No jail time. No =\r\npolice record. No justice.\r\n\r\nNot one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the =\r\nnear collapse of our entire economy. That will change under my =\r\nAdministration. \"Equal Justice Under Law\" will not just be words engraved =\r\non the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies =\r\nto Wall Street and all Americans.\r\n\r\n- Establish a tax on Wall Street to discourage reckless gambling and =\r\nencourage productive investments in the job-creating economy. We will use =\r\nthe revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition =\r\nfree. During the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed =\r\nout Wall Street. Now, it's Wall Street's turn to help the middle class.\r\n\r\n- Cap Credit Card Interest Rates and ATM Fees. We have got to stop =\r\nfinancial institutions from ripping off the American people by charging =\r\nsky-high interest rates and outrageous fees. In my view, it is =\r\nunacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to =\r\nthe ATM. And it is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying =\r\ncredit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent.\r\n\r\nThe Bible has a term for this practice. It's called usury. And in The =\r\nDivine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of =\r\nHell for sinners who charged people usurious interest rates. Today, we =\r\ndon't need the hellfire and the pitchforks, we don't need the rivers of =\r\nboiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.\r\n\r\nWe need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 =\r\npercent. I would also cap ATM fees at $2.\r\n\r\n- Allow Post Offices to Offer Banking Services. We also need to give =\r\nAmericans affordable banking options. The reality is that, unbelievably, =\r\nmillions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no =\r\nnormal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and =\r\nyou need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a =\r\nmedical emergency, where do you go? You go to a payday lender who could =\r\ncharge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious =\r\ncycle of debt. That is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nWe need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. =\r\nPost offices exist in almost every community in our country. One important =\r\nway to provide decent banking opportunities for low-income communities is =\r\nto allow the U.S. Postal Service to engage in basic banking services, and =\r\nthat's what I will fight for.\r\n\r\n- Reform Credit Rating Agencies. We cannot have a safe and sound financial =\r\nsystem if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial =\r\nproducts. The only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit =\r\nrating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street. Under my =\r\nadministration, we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into =\r\nnon-profit institutions, independent from Wall Street. No longer will Wall =\r\nStreet be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their =\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n- Reform the Federal Reserve. We need to structurally reform the Federal =\r\nReserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs =\r\nof ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street. It is =\r\nunacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very =\r\nbankers it is in charge of regulating. When Wall Street was on the verge =\r\nof collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to =\r\nsave the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness =\r\nto combat the unemployment crisis and fulfill its full employment mandate.\r\n\r\nSo my message to you is straightforward: I'll rein in Wall Street's =\r\nreckless behavior so they can't crash our economy again.\r\n\r\nWill Wall Street like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm =\r\npresident? You better believe it.\r\n\r\nThat is our plan to create an economy that works for all Americans, not =\r\njust a handful of billionaires. If you agree with what we want to do, add =\r\nyour name to say that you stand with me:\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/wall-street\r\n\r\nNo president alone, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else, can effectively =\r\naddress the crises facing the working families of this country without a =\r\npowerful grassroots movement. When we stand together, there is nothing we =\r\ncannot accomplish.\r\n\r\nThank you for standing with me.\r\n\r\nIn solidarity,\r\n\r\nBernie Sanders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPaid for by Bernie 2016\r\n(not the billionaires)\r\n\r\nPO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIE\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to 98xjsmith@gmail.com.

Every day, I talk with my volunteers about =\r\nhow Bernie's health care plan would guarantee health care as a right and =\r\nwould be implemented in every state regardless of who is governor. That's =\r\nimportant for everyone in New Hampshire because right now, the State =\r\nLegislature is getting ready to debate if Medicaid expansion will be =\r\nreauthorized. Healthcare should be a right, not a whim of elected =\r\nofficials. Will you join us in demanding that Medicaid expansion is =\r\nreauthorized in New Hampshire?\r\n\r\nIt's a pretty simple concept: protect people's health coverage today while =\r\nwe work to win universal health care in the future. And, this is personal =\r\nfor me, because I'm six months into remission from cancer.\r\n\r\nADD YOUR NAME: =\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/protectmedicaidexpansionNH\r\n\r\nLast year, I was a psychiatric social worker working with low-income and =\r\nat-risk people. Listening to my clients, I heard about the struggles they =\r\nfaced in trying to prove eligibility for Medicaid. When they did end up =\r\nwith coverage, their lives improved and they were able to have consistent =\r\ntreatment. It's disappointing in America that healthcare is not a right =\r\nbut a privilege -- and that's what we are trying to fix. In the meantime, =\r\nhealth insurance is a lifesaver.\r\n\r\nI should know because quality health insurance saved my life. Thanks to =\r\nthose before me who organized my workplace, I was a member of a union. So =\r\nwhen I was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer, I had top-level health =\r\ninsurance, paid medical leave and the security of knowing that I wouldn't =\r\nend up in debt from expensive treatments. I'm a cancer survivor because I =\r\nhad a job with a union and health insurance. Everyone in America should =\r\nhave access to that same level of care.\r\n\r\nThat's why I quit my incredible job and came to work for Bernie in New =\r\nHampshire. But it's wrong that so many others face illness or injury =\r\nwithout access to health care. It's wrong that another young woman my age =\r\nwho doesn't have insurance would not be able to get the care she deserves. =\r\nAnd that's why I am asking you to fight to protect Medicaid expansion =\r\nwhile we work to elect Bernie.\r\n\r\nWill you join Bernie in demanding that New Hampshire reauthorize Medicaid =\r\nexpansion this year? It's so important. =\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/protectmedicaidexpansionNH\r\n\r\nWorking on this campaign has filled me with the energy to recover fully =\r\nfrom my illness.

Wade =\r\ndecision 43 years ago today. This was a tremendous step to protect women's =\r\nhealth and to affirm their control of their own bodies.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, since the Roe v. Wade decision, extreme right-wing =\r\npoliticians in states have made it more and more difficult for women to =\r\nactually access abortion care, aided in many cases by the federal Hyde =\r\nAmendment and other anti-abortion policies. Nearly a quarter of these =\r\nrestrictions have come in the last five years. This is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe extreme right-wing works tirelessly to make it more difficult for =\r\nwomen to access reproductive health care. Republicans in office work to =\r\nshut down clinics while extremists terrorize health care providers and =\r\ntheir patients. Making women travel hundreds of miles, wait weeks for an =\r\nappointment and face harassment at the clinic door is a national disgrace.\r\n\r\nSo today, on the anniversary of this important Supreme Court decision, we =\r\nmust affirm not only the right to have an abortion, but we must protect =\r\nthe right to access a doctor or clinic who can perform that procedure.\r\n\r\nAdd your name to mine if you agree we must expand access to reproductive =\r\nhealth care and protect Roe v. Wade:\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/roe-v-wade\r\n\r\nWe are not going back to the days when women had to risk their lives to =\r\nend an unwanted pregnancy. The decision about abortion must remain a =\r\ndecision for a woman and her doctor to make, not the government.\r\n\r\nWe are not going to allow the extreme right-wing to defund Planned =\r\nParenthood, we are going to expand it. Planned Parenthood provides vital =\r\nhealthcare services for millions of people, who rely on its clinics every =\r\nyear for affordable, quality health care services including cancer =\r\nprevention, STI and HIV testing and general primary health care services. =\r\nThe current attempt to malign Planned Parenthood is part of a long-term =\r\nsmear campaign by people who want to deny women in this country the right =\r\nto control their own bodies.\r\n\r\nWe are not going back to the days when women did not have full access to =\r\nbirth control. Incredibly, almost all of the Republicans in Congress are =\r\nin favor of giving any employer who provides health insurance, or any =\r\ninsurance company, the ability to deny coverage for contraception or any =\r\nother kind of procedure if the employer had a \"moral\" objection to it. =\r\nThat is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nUnder my administration, we will protect and expand the fundamental rights =\r\nof women to control their own bodies. I promise to only nominate Supreme =\r\nCourt Justices who support Roe v. Wade. Our Medicare-for-all plan would =\r\ncover reproductive health care, including abortion, because all health =\r\ncare is a right, not a privilege. And I would work to repeal the federal =\r\nHyde Amendment, which currently restricts the federal government from =\r\nspending any money on abortion care. That is wrong, and it will be =\r\nabolished when I am president.\r\n\r\nAdd your name to mine if you agree we must expand access to reproductive =\r\nhealth care and protect Roe v.

It =\r\ngave billionaires like the Koch Brothers an even bigger opportunity to =\r\npurchase the House, the Senate, even the White House.\r\n\r\nSuper PACs -- a direct outgrowth of the Citizens United decision -- are =\r\nenabling the wealthiest people and the largest corporations in this =\r\ncountry to spend unlimited amounts on elections. We know, for example, =\r\nthat the Koch brothers, the second wealthiest family in America, want to =\r\nuse the Citizens United decision to buy politicians across the country. =\r\nThis election cycle alone, they have committed to spend at least $750 =\r\nmillion on political activities -- an outrageous sum that is corrupting =\r\nour political process. And I can assure you, brothers and sisters, they =\r\nwon't be spending that money with the interests of working families, =\r\nwomen, and seniors in mind. That is simply unacceptable, and it's time for =\r\nthe American people to rise up and reclaim our democracy.\r\n\r\nI need you to sign up to volunteer during the final four days of the New =\r\nHampshire primary. Working together is our path to defeating big money and =\r\noverturning Citizens United.\r\n\r\nCan I count on you to sign up to volunteer?  =\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-gotv\r\n\r\n=20\r\nLet's be honest and acknowledge what we are talking about. We are talking =\r\nabout a rapid movement in this country towards a political system in which =\r\na handful of very wealthy people and special interests will determine who =\r\ngets elected or who does not get elected. That is not what this country is =\r\nsupposed to be about. That was not Abraham Lincoln's vision of a =\r\ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people.\r\n\r\nThe need for real campaign finance reform is not a progressive issue. It =\r\nis not a conservative issue. It is an American issue. It is an issue that =\r\nshould concern all Americans, regardless of their political point of view, =\r\nwho wish to preserve the essence of the longest standing democracy in the =\r\nworld -- a government that represents all of the people and not a handful =\r\nof powerful and wealthy special interests.\r\n\r\nOur campaign is doing so well because we are telling the truth about the =\r\nreality of American life today. We are talking about a reality in which =\r\nmost of the new wealth and income in this country are going to the top one =\r\npercent while working families are struggling more than at any point since =\r\nthe Great Depression.\r\n\r\nMy vision for American democracy is a nation in which all people, =\r\nregardless of their income, can participate in the political process, and =\r\ncan run for office without begging for contributions from the wealthy and =\r\nthe powerful. While other politicians will make you the same promise, I am =\r\nthe only candidate running for the Democratic nomination who does not have =\r\na super PAC. And I am the only one who is telling the truth about the =\r\ncorrupting influence of Wall Street bankers and the obscenely wealthy in =\r\nour elections.\r\n\r\nWe have to create a political revolution where working Americans come =\r\ntogether to say they have had ENOUGH of the billionaire class buying our =\r\nelections to enrich themselves while everyone else gets poorer. More than =\r\never, we need a president who has a firm commitment to the American people =\r\n-- and no one else.\r\n\r\nSign up today to commit to volunteering in New Hampshire between February =\r\n6th-9th. These are the final moments to make sure every one of our =\r\nsupporters near you are reminded to get out to vote on primary day.\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/nh-gotv\r\n\r\nOur vision for democracy should be one in which candidates are speaking to =\r\nthe vast majority of our people - working people, the middle class, =\r\nlow-income people, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor - and =\r\ndiscussing with them their ideas as to how we can improve lives for all =\r\npeople in this country.\r\n\r\nI believe this vision of America can be a reality once again. We just have =\r\nto do something unprecedented in the coming months -- defy the odds and =\r\nwin the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.\r\n\r\nI am glad you are standing with us.\r\n\r\nIn solidarity,\r\nBernie Sanders\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPaid for by Bernie 2016\r\n(not the billionaires)\r\n\r\nPO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIE\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to 98xjsmith@gmail.com.

It's a bit of a stretch, but it's within =\r\nthe spirit of this campaign to accomplish what everyone else thinks is =\r\nimpossible. So here it goes:\r\n\r\nMake a $2.70 contribution to our campaign and help us hit our goal of =\r\nraising $40 million in February before tonight's critical FEC fundraising =\r\ndeadline:\r\n\r\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/our-goal\r\n\r\nWe started today having raised $36,105,613 in February from more than 1.2 =\r\nmillion individual contributions.

I don't think that's right.\r\n\r\nNo matter what, you can bet that Pfizer would continue to overcharge =\r\nAmericans for prescription drugs, too. Since 2014, the pharmaceutical =\r\ncompany has hiked the prices of seven of its top selling drugs by an =\r\naverage of 39 percent.\r\n\r\nPfizer also charges 12 times as much in the U.S. under Medicare for these =\r\ndrugs as it charges in Ireland, where it's claiming a new address for tax =\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAll of this is the result of years of weakened tax laws, an abdication of =\r\nresponsibility by American companies to their country, and a corrupt =\r\npolitical system that allows it to happen.\r\n\r\nAnd I believe we can stop it.\r\n\r\nAdd your name and together we can stop Pfizer's corporate tax dodge and =\r\ntake a big step forward for our political revolution;\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/pfizer-must-pay-taxes\r\n\r\nThank you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn solidarity,\r\n\r\nBernie Sanders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPaid for by Bernie 2016\r\n(not the billionaires)\r\n\r\nPO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIE\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to 98xjsmith@gmail.com.

The primary calendar is shifting in our favor, with many states =\r\ncoming up where we can win - or win big. But to make up critical ground =\r\nand take this all the way to November, we're going to need each and every =\r\none of you to volunteer if you haven't already, or double down and =\r\nvolunteer again if you're already involved.\r\n\r\nYou can help Bernie win by calling voters in the upcoming states from home =\r\nusing our dialer system, or by hosting a phonebank event to make a lot of =\r\ncalls with other Bernie supporters.\r\n\r\nYES, I WILL MAKE CALLS FROM HOME:\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/phonebank/\r\n\r\nYES, I'LL HOST A PHONEBANKING PARTY:\r\nhttps://bernie16.cp.bsd.net/page/signup/host-a-phonebank-for-bernie?source=\r\n=3Dem160319\r\n\r\nNothing worth fighting for will be easy. This campaign has always been a =\r\nlong shot, and it's indisputable that this past Tuesday our path to the =\r\nnomination narrowed a bit.\r\n\r\nBut let's be clear about one thing: there is absolutely still a path to =\r\nvictory. And this movement - which has already reshaped American politics =\r\n- is not about to give up, with 24 states still left to go.\r\n\r\nThe pundits can't stop our campaign. They couldn't stop it when they =\r\nignored us for months before Iowa and wrote us off as a protest campaign. =\r\nAnd they can't stop us now. We're not giving up, and we know you won't =\r\neither. There's too much at stake to leave this political revolution =\r\nunfinished.\r\n\r\nIt's an honor to be with you in this movement.\r\n\r\nIn solidarity,\r\n\r\nClaire Sandberg\r\nBernie 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPaid for by Bernie 2016\r\n(not the billionaires)\r\n\r\nPO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIE\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to 98xjsmith@gmail.com.

Please read Bernie's note below and add your name =\r\nto help stop Pfizer from dodging $35 billion in taxes.\r\n\r\n****Email from Senator Bernie Sanders:******\r\n\r\nI want to tell you about something that encapsulates so much of what is =\r\nwrong with our economy, our government, and our corrupt political system. =\r\nThen I'm going to ask for your help to stop it.\r\n\r\nPfizer is a giant pharmaceutical company based in New York City that has a =\r\nhistory of overcharging Americans for prescription drugs. It's in the =\r\nprocess of trying to merge with another company located in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIf the merger is successful, Pfizer would technically become a foreign =\r\ncompany, meaning it could dodge around $35 BILLION in corporate taxes here =\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nEnough is enough. Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies cannot be =\r\nallowed to evade taxes and rip off American patients who already pay the =\r\nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\r\n\r\nI sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew asking him to prevent =\r\nPfizer from taking many of the steps it wants in order to avoid paying =\r\ntaxes in America. Can you add your name to say you want Pfizer to pay the =\r\ntaxes it owes?\r\n\r\nADD YOUR NAME =C2=BB =\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/pfizer-must-pay-taxes\r\n\r\nWhat Pfizer is trying to do is known as a \"corporate inversion.\" In this =\r\ncase, Pfizer, an American company, is merging with a company based abroad. =\r\nThe result of the merger is a company with an address in another country - =\r\neven though the majority of shareholders are still based in America.\r\n\r\nPfizer apparently doesn't want to pay the $35 billion in taxes it would =\r\nowe in America. I don't think that's right.\r\n\r\nNo matter what, you can bet that Pfizer would continue to overcharge =\r\nAmericans for prescription drugs, too. Since 2014, the pharmaceutical =\r\ncompany has hiked the prices of seven of its top selling drugs by an =\r\naverage of 39 percent.\r\n\r\nPfizer also charges 12 times as much in the U.S. under Medicare for these =\r\ndrugs as it charges in Ireland, where it's claiming a new address for tax =\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAll of this is the result of years of weakened tax laws, an abdication of =\r\nresponsibility by American companies to their country, and a corrupt =\r\npolitical system that allows it to happen.\r\n\r\nAnd I believe we can stop it.\r\n\r\nAdd your name and together we can stop Pfizer's corporate tax dodge and =\r\ntake a big step forward for our political revolution;\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/pfizer-must-pay-taxes\r\n\r\nThank you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn solidarity,\r\n\r\nBernie Sanders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPaid for by Bernie 2016\r\n(not the billionaires)\r\n\r\nPO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIE\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to 98xjsmith@gmail.com.

I got an email last night from a woman who waited five hours to =\r\nvote in Arizona. Five hours.\r\n\r\nWe don't know how many thousands of people didn't get to cast their =\r\nballots yesterday in Arizona because they couldn't afford to wait that =\r\nlong. Scenes on cable news last night showed hundreds of people in line at =\r\n11:30pm in Phoenix - more than four hours after polls closed. Voting =\r\nshould not be this difficult.\r\n\r\nOne reason it is so hard to vote in Arizona is because the Supreme Court =\r\ngutted the Voting Rights Act. There were 70 percent fewer polling places =\r\nthis year than in 2012 in Phoenix's county. They wouldn't have been =\r\nallowed to cut those polling places if the Voting Rights Act was still in =\r\ntact.\r\n\r\nThese cuts meant that, in a county with more than 4 million residents, =\r\nthere were just 60 polling places. This is unacceptable, but it's also not =\r\nan isolated incident.\r\n\r\nWe need to make it easier to vote, not more difficult. One way we can do =\r\nthat is by reaffirming our support for the Voting Rights Act, which, when =\r\nI am president, I will fight to reinstate.\r\n\r\nAdd your name to say you support reinstating the Voting Rights Act so we =\r\ncan make voting easier for everybody, not more difficult.\r\n\r\nADD YOUR NAME =C2=BB =\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/reinstate-voting-rights-act\r\n\r\nWe cannot continue to see democracy undermined in the United States of =\r\nAmerica.

It is no wonder that government no =\r\nlonger works for ordinary Americans.\r\n\r\nAbove all, we need to remember the price that was paid for the right to =\r\nvote. The Voting Rights Act was one of the great victories of the civil =\r\nrights movement. Now, as then, change comes when the people demand it -- =\r\nin the voting booth, and on the streets in peaceful demonstrations. We =\r\nmust remind ourselves of what's been achieved in the past, and resolve to =\r\ndo equally great things in the future. Democracy is not a spectator sport.\r\n\r\nIt is my sincere hope that the states that vote in the coming weeks and =\r\nmonths do better than what we saw yesterday in Arizona. Too much is at =\r\nstake for our future.\r\n\r\nRight now, what we can do is show your support by adding your name to say =\r\nyou want to reinstate the Voting Rights Act.

Add your =\r\n$2.70 contribution in support of our campaign.\r\n\r\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/we-are-at-a-moment-of-truth\r\n\r\nI run not to oppose any man or woman, but to propose new and far-reaching =\r\npolicies to deal with the crises of our times. And I run because I know we =\r\nmust change course now, or risk losing the future for so many to the =\r\ninterests of so few.\r\n\r\nA successful national campaign is a massive undertaking, especially when =\r\nwe will be heavily outspent. It will require the active participation of =\r\nmillions of Americans in every community in our country. In fact, it will =\r\nrequire nothing less than a political revolution which combats the =\r\ndemoralization and alienation of so many of our people from the political =\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nLet me be very honest. It may be too late to stop the billionaire class =\r\nfrom trying to buy the Presidency and Congress. The forces of greed =\r\nalready may be too powerful.\r\n\r\nBut we owe it to our children and grandchildren to try. We owe it to them =\r\nto make the fight and, through the power of our numbers, turn back this =\r\nassault on the foundation of our democracy and our future.\r\n\r\nWe are at a moment of truth. We need to face up to the reality of where we =\r\nare as a nation, and we need a mass movement of people to fight for =\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nI believe America is ready for a new path to the future.\r\n\r\nOn May 26th I will formally launch our campaign at the City Hall in =\r\nBurlington, Vermont, where I served as Mayor.\r\n\r\nI ask you to join with me in our campaign for President of the United =\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSenator Bernie Sanders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPaid for by Bernie 2016\r\n(not the billionaires)\r\n\r\nPO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIE\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to 98xjsmith@gmail.com.

They voted for =\r\nBernie, for his ideas, and for our movement. And for each voter we =\r\ncontact, we'll win more states, win more pledged delegates, and win the =\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nThis coming Tuesday, five more states vote, with 384 delegates up for =\r\ngrabs. We need to win every delegate possible in these contests to take a =\r\nbig bite out of our opponent's lead before the primary season moves =\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\nSo we're calling for an all-hands-on-deck mobilization this Saturday =\r\nthrough Monday to find Bernie supporters in the April 26th states and get =\r\nthem out to vote.

But if we can hit our goal for =\r\ncallers, together we'll make over 3.5 MILLION calls into the states that =\r\nvote next Tuesday, which could make a yuuuge difference in some of these =\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nSign up to make some calls this weekend:\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/the-revolution-is-calling?source=3Dem1=\r\n60421\r\n\r\nIf you've never made phone calls to voters before, don't worry.

And every voter we =\r\ncall on the phones makes a difference for our delegate count.\r\n\r\nWhen we stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish - including =\r\nwinning this nomination.

And indeed, the majority of the money spent =\r\nby the Victory Fund has gone to benefit Hillary Clinton's primary campaign =\r\nagainst us. The piece said some state party fundraisers believe they are =\r\nbasically acting as \"money-laundering conduits.\"\r\n\r\nThere's more, but first let me get to the part where you can take action. =\r\nIn recent weeks, the Clinton campaign has expressed a lot of interest in =\r\nwhat is important to Bernie's supporters. Here's your chance to send a =\r\nmessage about our distaste for big-money in politics:\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/victory-fund\r\n\r\nHere's how the scheme works for the Clinton campaign:\r\n\r\nRich people like Alice Walton of Walmart who have already contributed the =\r\nmaximum amount allowable to the Clinton campaign can contribute an =\r\nadditional $350,000-plus to the Victory Fund.\r\n\r\nThe first $33,400 of her contribution is supposed to go the DNC, and the =\r\nrest divided up between participating state parties. But that's not what's =\r\nbeen happening. The Victory Fund has mostly been doing one of two things =\r\nwith Ms. Walton's money:\r\n\r\n1. Taking that money and spending it on advertisements and small-dollar =\r\nfundraising solicitations. Then they take all the small-dollar =\r\ncontributions and data reaped from Alice Walton's contribution and =\r\ntransfer it directly to the Clinton campaign. This tactic is basically a =\r\nway for them to benefit from a contribution much larger than the legal =\r\nlimit from Alice Walton.\r\n\r\n2. They take Alice Walton's money and transfer it to state parties, who =\r\nthen immediately transfer it to the DNC. Often times they do it without =\r\nthe state party even knowing because the Clinton campaign controls many of =\r\nthe bank accounts involved. So at the end of the day, most of the state =\r\nparties have received exactly $0 from their Victory Fund arrangement.\r\n\r\nSo, now we that we know the Clinton campaign is taking advantage of state =\r\nparties to skirt fundraising limits on her presidential campaign, it's =\r\ntime for her to do the right thing and let the state parties keep their =\r\nfair share of the cash:\r\n\r\nSign our petition calling on the Clinton campaign to stop bending campaign =\r\nfinance rules to their breaking point, and immediately transfer all the =\r\nmoney allowable to the state parties participating in the \"Hillary Victory =\r\nFund.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/victory-fund\r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that Hillary Clinton has benefited from tens of millions =\r\nof dollars in cash transfers and advertising to campaign against us in the =\r\nprimary. But it's not too late for her campaign to do the right thing by =\r\nthe state parties we're going to need to win elections up and down the =\r\nticket this November.\r\n\r\nI'm sure if you sign our petition, that is something they will notice.\r\n\r\nIn solidarity,\r\n\r\nJeff Weaver\r\nCampaign Manager\r\nBernie 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPaid for by Bernie 2016\r\n(not the billionaires)\r\n\r\nPO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIE\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to 98xjsmith@gmail.com.

Living in poverty doesn't just mean you don't have enough =\r\nmoney to buy a big screen TV, a fancy laptop, or the latest iPhone. It =\r\ngoes much deeper than that.\r\n\r\nLiving in poverty means you are less likely to have a good grocery store =\r\nin your community selling healthy food. Far too often it means you don't =\r\nknow where your next meal is going to come from. Living in poverty means =\r\nyou are less likely to have access to a doctor, dentist or mental health =\r\ncare provider. It means you have less access to public transportation, =\r\nwhich makes it harder to find a job. It means you are less likely to have =\r\naccess to child care.\r\n\r\nIn the United States of America, poverty is often a death sentence.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I spoke about poverty in McDowell County, West Virginia -- one =\r\nof the poorest counties in one of the poorest states in America. In 2014, =\r\nover 35 percent of the residents in McDowell lived in poverty, including =\r\nnearly half of the children. The roads are crumbling and only 6 percent of =\r\nadults have a college education. Less than two-thirds have graduated high =\r\nschool. It has the lowest life expectancy for men in the entire nation. I =\r\nhope you'll watch part of my speech on poverty and share it with friends =\r\nand family on social media.\r\n\r\nWATCH THE VIDEO: =\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/share/poverty-is-a-death-sentence\r\n\r\nPoverty is an issue we must address. In 2011, the American Journal of =\r\nPublic Health found that 130,000 people died in just one year alone as a =\r\nresult of poverty.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue we can just sweep under the rug and hope it will go =\r\naway. Because it won't.\r\n\r\nAnd when I talk about it being too late for establishment politics and =\r\neconomics, this is what I mean. When I talk about thinking big and outside =\r\nthe box, about rejecting incremental change, I am talking about the =\r\nmillions of Americans who live in poverty who have been tossed out, left =\r\nbehind, and abandoned by the rich and powerful. We need to create an =\r\neconomy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.\r\n\r\nHere's what we need to do:\r\n\r\n1. Rebuild our country's crumbling infrastructure. A $1 trillion =\r\ninvestment in our infrastructure will create at least 13 million jobs all =\r\nover America - jobs that cannot be outsourced.\r\n2. We must rewrite our disastrous trade politics that enable corporate =\r\nAmerica to shut down plans in places like West Virginia and move them to =\r\nMexico, China, and other low-wage countries.\r\n3. We can create 1 million jobs for disadvantaged youths through =\r\nlegislation I introduced with Rep. John Conyers of Michigan.\r\n4. We need to increase the wages of at least 53 million American workers =\r\nby raising the minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to $15 =\r\nan hour.\r\n5. At a time when women workers earn 79 cents for every dollar a man =\r\nearns, we need to sign the Paycheck Fairness Act into law. Equal pay for =\r\nequal work.\r\n6. We need to make health care a right for every man, woman, and child =\r\nthrough a Medicare for All single-payer system.\r\n7. We need to treat drug addiction like a mental health issue, not a =\r\ncriminal issue.\r\n8. We need to ensure every worker in this country has at least 12 weeks of =\r\npaid family and medical leave, two weeks of paid vacation, and one week of =\r\npaid sick days.\r\n9. We need to impose a tax on Wall Street to make public colleges and =\r\nuniversities tuition free while substantially reducing student debt.\r\n10. At a time when half of older workers have no retirement savings, we're =\r\nnot going to cut Social Security, we're going to expand it so people can =\r\nretire with dignity and respect.\r\n\r\nIn solidarity,\r\n\r\nBernie Sanders\r\n\r\nWATCH THE VIDEO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPaid for by Bernie 2016\r\n(not the billionaires)\r\n\r\nPO Box 905 - Burlington VT 05402 United States - (855) 4-BERNIE\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to 98xjsmith@gmail.com.

He was not a refugee fleeing war, although much of his =\r\nfamily later became victims of the Holocaust. He came to America looking =\r\nto make a better life.

Monsanto, agribusiness and the =\r\nbio-tech industry have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to =\r\noverturn legislation passed by Vermont, Connecticut, Maine and Alaska that =\r\ncalls for the labeling of GMO food. In fact, they are moving aggressively =\r\nnow because Vermont's strong law goes into effect today.\r\n\r\nThis legislation is important because people have a right to know what is =\r\nin the food they and their children eat. The more information we have, the =\r\nbetter consumers we become. This is not a radical idea. It is why over 60 =\r\ncountries around the world have passed GMO labeling laws.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the major agribusiness and bio-tech companies disagree. =\r\nThey do not believe people have a right to know what's in the food they =\r\neat. That is why they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in =\r\nlobbying and campaign contributions to overturn the GMO right-to-know =\r\nlegislation that states have already passed and that many other states are =\r\non the verge of passing.\r\n\r\nA bill in the Senate would overrule Vermont's law, and prevent states from =\r\npassing similar laws. This bill, introduced by Senators Pat Roberts (R-KS) =\r\nand Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) will be coming up for a vote on Wednesday or =\r\nThursday of next week. It must be defeated.\r\n\r\nCan you write to your senators today and ask them to oppose the GMO bill? =\r\nYou can click here and we'll direct you to write your senators =\r\nimmediately:\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/speakout/stop-the-gmo-labeling-bill\r\n\r\nTheir goal is to deny states the right to go forward in this area and to =\r\npass legislation that is useless and with no value to consumers. And, if =\r\nwe don't stop them, they may just succeed.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday evening, with no hearings and no debate, a corporate-backed =\r\nbill was introduced on to the floor by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\r\n\r\nThis legislation would create a confusing, misleading and unenforceable =\r\nnational standard for labeling GMOs. Instead of a uniform labeling =\r\nstandard like Vermont's law, the language allows text, symbols, or an =\r\nelectronic code to be used. This is intentionally confusing to consumers, =\r\nand the information may be entirely inaccessible if the consumer does not =\r\nhave access to the internet.\r\n\r\nPerhaps most shockingly, this bill imposes no penalties whatsoever for =\r\nviolating the labeling requirement, making the law essentially =\r\nmeaningless. Thus, this is a weak bill, full of loopholes, without any =\r\nrequirement to comply.\r\n\r\nThe issue of labeling our food isn't controversial. The overwhelming =\r\nmajority of Americans favor GMO labeling. People have a right to know what =\r\nis in the food they eat. The Senate shouldn't stop states from passing =\r\nlaws that let that happen.\r\n\r\nCongress must stand up to the demands of Monsanto and other multi-national =\r\nfood industry corporations and reject this outrageous, weak, and confusing =\r\nbill. I will continue to do my best to defeat it, and take the necessary =\r\naction to protect Vermont's GMO labeling efforts.

When we began this historic campaign, we were considered fringe =\r\nplayers by the political, economic and media establishment. Well, we =\r\nproved them wrong.\r\n\r\nWe showed that the American people support a bold, progressive agenda that =\r\ntakes on the billionaire class, that fights for racial, social, economic =\r\nand environmental justice and that seeks to create a government that works =\r\nfor all of us and not just the big campaign donors.\r\n\r\nWe mobilized over 13 million voters across the country. We won 23 =\r\nDemocratic primary and caucus contests. We had literally hundreds of =\r\nthousands of volunteers across the country. And we showed - in a way that =\r\ncan change politics in America forever - that you can run a competitive =\r\nnational grassroots campaign without begging millionaires and billionaires =\r\nfor campaign contributions.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, we elevated the critical issues facing our country - =\r\nissues the establishment has pushed under the rug for too long. We focused =\r\nattention on the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this =\r\ncountry and the importance of breaking up the large banks who brought our =\r\neconomy to the brink of collapse. We exposed our horrendous trade =\r\npolicies, our broken criminal justice system, and our people's lack of =\r\naccess to affordable health care and higher education. We fought =\r\naggressively to address the crisis of climate change, the need for real =\r\ncomprehensive immigration reform, the importance of developing a foreign =\r\npolicy that values diplomacy over war, and so much more.\r\n\r\nWe have shown throughout this election that these are issues that are =\r\nimportant to voters and that progressive solutions energize people in the =\r\nfight for real change. What we have accomplished so far is historic - but =\r\nour work is far from over.\r\n\r\nThis movement of ours - this political revolution - must continue. We =\r\ncannot let all of the momentum we have achieved in the fight to transform =\r\nAmerica be lost. We will never stop fighting for what is right.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in terms of winning the Democratic nomination, we did come =\r\nup short. But this election was never about me or any candidate. It was =\r\nabout the powerful coming together of millions of people to take their =\r\ncountry back from the billionaire class. That was the strength of our =\r\ncampaign and it will be the strength of our movement going forward in the =\r\nmonths and years ahead.\r\n\r\nIn the coming weeks, I will be announcing the creation of successor =\r\norganizations to carry on the struggle that we have been a part of these =\r\npast 15 months. I hope you will continue to be involved in fighting to =\r\ntransform America. Our goal will be to advance the progressive agenda that =\r\nwe believe in and to elect like-minded candidates at the federal, state =\r\nand local levels who are committed to accomplishing our goals.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the presidential election this November, there is no doubt =\r\nthat the election of Donald Trump as president would be a devastating blow =\r\nto all that we are fighting for. His openly bigoted and pro-billionaire =\r\ncampaign could precipitate the same decades-long rightward shift in =\r\nAmerican politics that happened after the election of Ronald Reagan in =\r\n1980. That rightward shift after Reagan's election infected not just =\r\npolitics as a whole but led to the ascendancy of the corporatist wing of =\r\nthe Democratic Party - an era from which we are still recovering.\r\n\r\nI cannot in good conscience let that happen.\r\n\r\nTo have all of the work we have done in elevating our progressive ideals =\r\nbe dashed away by a complete Republican takeover of Washington - a =\r\ntakeover headed by a candidate that demonizes Latinos, Muslims, women, =\r\nAfrican Americans, veterans, and others - would be unthinkable.\r\n\r\nToday, I endorsed Hillary Clinton to be our next president. I know that =\r\nsome of you will be disappointed with that decision. But I believe that, =\r\nat this moment, our country, our values, and our common vision for a =\r\ntransformed America, are best served by the defeat of Donald Trump and the =\r\nelection of Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nYou should know that in the weeks since the last primary, both campaigns =\r\nhave worked together in good faith to bridge some of the policy issues =\r\nthat divided us during the election. Did we come to agreement on =\r\neverything? Of course not. But we made important steps forward.\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton released a debt free college plan that we developed =\r\ntogether which now includes free tuition at public colleges and =\r\nuniversities for working families. This was a major part of our campaign's =\r\nagenda and a proposal that, if enacted into law, would revolutionize =\r\nhigher education in this country.\r\n\r\nSecretary Clinton has also publicly committed to massive investments in =\r\nhealth care for communities across this country that will increase primary =\r\ncare, including mental health care, dental care, and low-cost prescription =\r\ndrug access for an additional 25 million people. Importantly, she has also =\r\nendorsed the enactment of a so-called public option to allow everyone in =\r\nthis country to participate in a public insurance program. This idea was =\r\nkilled by the insurance industry during consideration of President Obama's =\r\nhealth care program.\r\n\r\nDuring the Democratic platform proceedings in St. Louis and Orlando, we =\r\nwere victorious in including amendments to make it a clear priority of the =\r\nDemocratic Party to fight for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, expand =\r\nSocial Security, abolish the death penalty, put a price on carbon, =\r\nestablish a path toward the legalization of marijuana, enact major =\r\ncriminal justice reforms, pass comprehensive immigration reform, end =\r\nfor-profit prisons and detention facilities, break up too-big-to-fail =\r\nbanks and create a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act, close loopholes that =\r\nallow big companies to avoid taxes by stashing their cash in offshore tax =\r\nhavens and use that revenue to rebuild America, approve the most expansive =\r\nagenda ever for protecting Native American rights and so much more.\r\n\r\nAll of these progressive policies were at the heart of our campaign. The =\r\ntruth is our movement is responsible for the most progressive Democratic =\r\nplatform in the history of our country. All of that is the direct result =\r\nof the work that our members of the platform committee did in the meetings =\r\nand that you have been doing over the last 15 months.\r\n\r\nBut none of these initiatives will happen if we do not elect a Democratic =\r\npresident in November. None! In fact, we will go backward. We must elect =\r\nthe Democratic nominee in November and progressive Democrats up and down =\r\nthe ballot so that we ensure that these policy commitments can advance.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely important that we keep our movement together, that we hold =\r\npublic officials accountable and that we elect progressive candidates to =\r\noffice at the federal, state, and local level who will stand with us.\r\n\r\nAs part of that effort, we still have a tremendous amount of work left to =\r\ndo in the Democratic Rules Committee that will be meeting in the coming =\r\nweeks. We have to enact the kinds of reforms to the Democratic Party and =\r\nto the electoral process that will provide us the tools to elect =\r\nprogressive candidates, to allow new voices and new energy into the Party, =\r\nand to break up the excessive power that the economic and political elites =\r\nin the Party currently have. As with our fights on the platform committee, =\r\nthat will only be possible if we stand together.\r\n\r\nYou should know that I intend to be actively campaigning throughout this =\r\nelection season to elect candidates who will stand by our agenda. I hope =\r\nto see many of you at events from coast to coast.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I again want to express my pride in what we have =\r\naccomplished together over the last year. But so much more must be done to =\r\nmake our vision a reality. Now more than ever our country needs our =\r\nmovement - our political revolution. As you have throughout this historic =\r\ncampaign, I ask for your ongoing support as we continue through the fall =\r\nand beyond.\r\n\r\nOn a personal note, I cannot say with words how appreciative Jane and I =\r\nare of the kindness, dedication and love we experienced from so many =\r\npeople across the country. We are deeply touched by it and will never, =\r\never forget it.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know that you will stand with me to defeat Donald Trump, and =\r\nto elect candidates who will stand by our agenda as part of the future of =\r\nour political revolution.

Well, 13 million votes later it appears that we =\r\nhave begun the process of transforming our country and radically changing =\r\nthe political landscape.

In a race in which everyone expected us to =\r\nbe outraised and outspent, you made more grassroots contributions than any =\r\nprimary campaign ever and proved that we could run a presidential campaign =\r\nwithout begging millionaires and billionaires for money. Some of the =\r\nwealthiest people in the world were prepared to spend billions of dollars =\r\nto stop you.\r\n\r\nYou built a grassroots organization that rivals anything seen before in =\r\nour country, knocking on millions of doors, making tens of millions of =\r\nphone calls, and building immense power in your communities.\r\n\r\nYou brought the issues of universal healthcare, combating climate change, =\r\nfree college tuition, a $15 minimum wage, and so many more progressive =\r\nissues to the forefront of the race for president.\r\n\r\nBut you did more than just make those issues part of the debate - you have =\r\nchanged the policy platform of the Democratic Party and of Secretary =\r\nHillary Clinton's campaign.\r\n\r\nBecause of our tireless work the Democratic Party has just passed the most =\r\nprogressive platform, by far, in the history of the party. Secretary =\r\nClinton now says that she will oppose the disastrous Trans Pacific =\r\nPartnership trade deal. She has also embraced parts of our plan to make =\r\ncollege tuition free - and if her new plan passes, it could revolutionize =\r\nthe way higher education is funded in our country. Secretary Clinton has =\r\nalso embraced the public option for health insurance, and now supports =\r\nsignificantly increased funding for community health centers. She adopted =\r\nthese positions because of you and your organizing.\r\n\r\nIt is critically important that we do not let up in our fight for a =\r\npolitical revolution.

What was revealed wasn't much of a shock =\r\nto us, because we knew all along that the establishment wasn't on our =\r\nside.\r\n\r\nBut now that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has resigned we have the opportunity =\r\nto transform the Democratic Party and open up its doors to working people =\r\nand young people -- people who want real change. Democrats must make it =\r\ncrystal clear that their party is prepared to take on Wall Street and the =\r\npowerful corporate interests whose greed is doing so much harm to our =\r\ncountry. We must stand with Americans who are working longer hours for =\r\nlower wages, the uninsured, students leaving school deeply in debt and all =\r\nthose worried about climate change.\r\n\r\nI believe Tim Canova is the kind of candidate whose policies will move the =\r\nDemocratic Party and our country in that direction. Electing Tim will send =\r\na strong message to the Democratic establishment about what this party =\r\nshould stand for. That's why I'm asking you today to help send him to =\r\nCongress:\r\n\r\nCan you rush a $3 contribution to Tim Canova's campaign today before this =\r\ncritical primary against Debbie Wasserman Schultz on August 30th?

This won't be an easy race and she needs =\r\nyour financial support.\r\n\r\nRick Nolan (Minnesota): Rick represents one of the most competitive =\r\ncongressional districts in the country, but he's been a strong fighter for =\r\nenacting single-payer health care, overturning Citizens United and ending =\r\noffshore tax havens. He's running against a multimillionaire CEO who =\r\nthinks he can pour millions into television ads, win himself a =\r\ncongressional seat, and then cast votes to cut taxes on the ultra-rich.\r\n\r\nPramila Jayapal (Washington): Pramila was a leader in the fight for paid =\r\nsick leave and a $15 minimum wage in Seattle. She's been taking on the =\r\nruling class in Washington state for years, and now we need to make sure =\r\nshe gets past a tough general election so that she can be one of our =\r\nstrongest allies in Congress.\r\n\r\nLet's win these races.

We will have a very, very narrow window to =\r\ndo so in lame duck session of Congress.\r\n\r\nWhile we've made great progress in the campaign to defeat the TPP, but we =\r\nmust continue to mobilize. Here's what we believe is happening, and what =\r\nwe need to do to defeat the TPP.\r\n\r\nThe good news is this: Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell just said =\r\nhe does not want to vote on TPP this year. And Secretary Hillary Clinton =\r\nhas also said TPP should not come up for a vote in this Congress.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is Wall Street, corporate America and their representatives =\r\nin Congress will try to pass this bad trade deal after the election =\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\nAs Bernie Sanders has said consistently, the TPP would expand to 12 other =\r\nnations the same failed \"free trade\" policies that have already cost =\r\nmillions of jobs and shuttered tens of thousands of factories across the =\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake: if TPP passes, it will further hurt consumers and cost =\r\nAmerican jobs.\r\n\r\nWe expect that, as early as the middle of September, the White House will =\r\nstart the process to \"fast track\" the TPP. From that point, it is likely =\r\nthat Congress must vote within 90 days.\r\n\r\nThis is our chance to make our voices heard. Say that you want to stop the =\r\nTPP -- add your name and help defeat this disastrous trade deal:\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stop-the-TPP?source=3Dem160827\r\n\r\nThe TPP follows in the footsteps of other unfettered free trade agreements =\r\nlike NAFTA and CAFTA that have been supported by corporate America and =\r\nthat cost America millions of decent-paying jobs.\r\n\r\nIn the past 25 years, nearly 60,000 manufacturing plants in this country =\r\nhave been shut down, and we have lost almost 5 million decent-paying =\r\nmanufacturing jobs. NAFTA alone led to the loss of almost three-quarters =\r\nof a million jobs -- the Permanent Normalized Trade Agreement with China =\r\ncost America four times that number: almost 3 million jobs. These =\r\nagreements are not the only reason why manufacturing in the United States =\r\nhas declined, but they are important factors.\r\n\r\nThe TPP would also give multinational corporations the ability to =\r\nchallenge laws passed in the United States that could negatively impact =\r\ntheir \"expected future profits.\" Take for example Trans Canada suing the =\r\nUnited States for $15 billion due to their \"lost profits\" from President =\r\nObama's decision to stop the Keystone Pipeline. Or Vattenfall, a Swedish =\r\nenergy company, has used this process to sue Germany for $5 billion over =\r\nits decision to phase out nuclear power. Should the people of Germany have =\r\nthe right to make energy choices on their own or should these decisions be =\r\nleft in the hands of an unelected international tribunal?\r\n\r\nWe face the same threats here at home if the TPP passes.\r\n\r\nVirtually every major union and environmental organization in the United =\r\nStates is against the deal. Major religious groups are as well because =\r\nthey know what it could mean for some of the poorest people on the planet.\r\n\r\nIf we're going to defeat the TPP, all of us need to be involved in not =\r\njust showing our opposition to this trade deal, but actively working to =\r\ndefeat it by getting organized.\r\n\r\nThat is why we are asking you today:\r\n\r\nSay that you stand with Bernie Sanders in opposition to the TPP, and will =\r\ndo whatever it takes to defeat it:\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stop-the-TPP?source=3Dem160827\r\n\r\nThank you for standing up to the TPP.

We =\r\nwere victorious in making it a clear priority of the Democratic Party to =\r\nfight for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, expand Social Security, =\r\nabolish the death penalty, put a price on carbon, enact major criminal =\r\njustice reforms, end for-profit prisons and detention facilities, break up =\r\ntoo-big-to-fail banks and create a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act, and so =\r\nmuch more.\r\n\r\nAnd just the other day, the Republican leadership in the Senate announced =\r\nthat the TPP would not be coming to the floor this year. Another major =\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nAll of that is the direct result of the grassroots activism that you, and =\r\nmillions of others, engaged in over the last 16 months. Now, we must =\r\ncontinue our efforts by electing progressive Democrats up and down the =\r\nballot so that the policies we have fought for can advance and become law.\r\n\r\nFor the future of our country, and our progressive agenda, it is =\r\nimperative that Democrats regain control of the Senate. My guess is that =\r\nwill all come down to which party wins three or four hotly contested races =\r\nin states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio and Nevada.\r\n\r\nThe Koch brothers know this.

If these four Democrats win the tight =\r\nelections they are currently in, the Democrats will almost certainly take =\r\ncontrol of the Senate.\r\n\r\nAnd what a world of difference that will make: real campaign finance =\r\nreform, raising the minimum wage, making public colleges and universities =\r\ntuition free, addressing the planetary crisis of climate change, =\r\nprogressive taxation, reforming our broken criminal justice system, =\r\ncomprehensive immigration reform and many other important issues.\r\n\r\nSplit a $3 contribution to help Katie McGinty, Maggie Hassan, Ted =\r\nStrickland, and Catherine Cortez Masto become senators and take back a =\r\nmajority in the Senate:\r\n\r\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/us_senate_slate\r\n\r\nI want to be clear: It is very important that our movement holds public =\r\nofficials accountable. The Democratic Party passed an extremely =\r\nprogressive agenda at the convention. Our job is to make sure that =\r\nplatform is implemented. That will not happen without Democratic control =\r\nof the Senate.\r\n\r\n- Katie McGinty was one of the first candidates to endorse a $15 minimum =\r\nwage.\r\n- Maggie Hassan, who is a strong supporter of campaign finance reform, =\r\nincreased transparency and disclosure of political contributions as =\r\nGovernor of New Hampshire.\r\n- Ted Strickland is a fighter for Ohio's working families who opposes the =\r\nTPP and believes that we need to completely change the way we negotiate =\r\ntrade deals.\r\n- Catherine Cortez Masto is committed to protecting the environment and =\r\nknows it's long past time that we ensure equal pay for women.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important reason to win a majority in the Senate is =\r\nbecause we must support nominees for the Supreme Court who will vote to =\r\noverturn Citizens United.\r\n\r\nIt is so important we do everything we can to help these four candidates - =\r\nKatie McGinty in Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, Ted =\r\nStrickland in Ohio, and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada - win their =\r\nelections in November.\r\n\r\nYour contribution of $3 will help each of these candidates for Senate win. =\r\nPlease split a contribution between them today so we can advance our =\r\nprogressive agenda, defeat the Koch brothers, and take back the Senate:\r\n\r\nhttps://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/us_senate_slate\r\n\r\nThank you as always for everything you do for our political revolution.\r\n\r\nIn solidarity,\r\n\r\nSenator Bernie Sanders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nPaid for by Friends of Bernie Sanders\r\n(not the billionaires)\r\n\r\nPO BOX 391, Burlington, VT 05402\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to 98xjsmith@gmail.com.

Bernie Sanders issued this =\r\ncall to action to support their work:\r\n\r\n\"The major global crisis facing our planet today is climate change. The =\r\nvast majority of scientists tell us that climate change is real, it is =\r\ncaused by humans and it is already causing devastating problems.

Regardless of the court's decision, the Dakota Access pipeline =\r\nmust be stopped. As a nation, our job is to break our addiction to fossil =\r\nfuels, not increase our dependence on oil. I join with the Standing Rock =\r\nSioux Tribe and the many tribal nations fighting this dangerous pipeline.\"\r\nWhen people stand together, we can defeat the greed of the biggest fossil =\r\nfuel companies. That's why today we're asking you to stand with the =\r\nactivists and tribal nations opposing the Dakota Access pipeline.\r\n\r\nAdd your name to say you oppose the construction of this fracked oil =\r\npipeline.\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stop-the-dakota-access-pipeline\r\n\r\nSomething shocking happened this weekend to the Lakota and Sioux activists =\r\nwho have been protesting the pipeline in North Dakota. The private =\r\nsecurity firm hired by the pipeline company attacked the activists with =\r\ndogs and pepper spray.\r\n\r\nThis is a dangerous escalation by a company that is apparently so =\r\ndesperate to build its $3.6 billion pipeline for fracked oil it would =\r\nattack peaceful activists.\r\n\r\nBecause the pipeline would go through their land, the Standing Rock Sioux =\r\nTribe and other nations have been leading prayer protests for months. =\r\nOther activists in the way of the pipeline have fought the oil company =\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nBut it's incumbent on all of us to stand up to this pipeline. For the =\r\ntribal nations who would have their lands endangered, for the farmers and =\r\nresidents who would have their water threatened, and for all of us who =\r\nneed to fight the effects of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that we can win: just this week, another pipeline that =\r\nwould move dirty oil was canceled after months of pressure from activists. =\r\nNow we must stop this one too.\r\n\r\nThe first step you can take is to speak out and say you oppose the Dakota =\r\nAccess pipeline and stand with the activists trying to stop it.\r\n\r\nSay you stand with activists who oppose the Dakota Access pipeline for =\r\nfracked oil.

But we still think =\r\nit's very important for you to understand exactly what we're facing in =\r\norder to win. Here's what you need to know:\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stop_tpp\r\n\r\nPresident Obama is the one person who can start the process to pass TPP.\r\n\r\nLast year President Obama sought, and won, approval from Congress to \"fast =\r\ntrack\" trade deals. That means that he can submit the TPP to Congress and =\r\nput it up for a vote without any amendments. Congress can approve it =\r\nas-is, or reject it. That's it.\r\n\r\nLegally, today is the first day that President Obama can do this. He's =\r\nsaid before that he would like to pass TPP in the lame duck session. We =\r\ndon't know if he's going to try this week, next week, or after the =\r\nelection, but we need to be ready to stop it in case he does try.\r\n\r\nIf President Obama does force a vote, realistically our best chance at =\r\ndefeating TPP is in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe reality of how the fast track process works is that TPP can't be =\r\namended -- not a single word. It's also true that TPP can't be =\r\nfilibustered in the Senate. It just needs 50 votes if President Obama =\r\ndecides to submit it to Congress.\r\n\r\nWe know that Bernie Sanders will oppose TPP, but the same can't be said =\r\nfor many other members of the Senate. If TPP comes up in the Senate, it's =\r\nlikely it will pass. It's not great, but that's what we're facing.\r\n\r\nOur best chance to defeat TPP is in the House of Representatives. If we =\r\ncan get a majority of members of Congress to vote no on TPP, we can win. =\r\nSo we must focus our efforts there.\r\n\r\nWednesday is a national day of action focusing on the House of =\r\nRepresentatives to stop TPP.\r\n\r\nFor years, a big coalition of labor, environmental, trade, and other =\r\ngroups has worked to stop TPP. Together these groups have millions of =\r\nmembers who have spoken out, made phone calls, lobbied politicians, and =\r\ndone everything they can to stop TPP.\r\n\r\nAll of these groups and all of their members - including Our Revolution - =\r\nare building towards a huge day of action this Wednesday focused on the =\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to place at least 50,000 calls to members of Congress and =\r\ntheir offices on Wednesday. With your help, we're going to help lead this =\r\nfight and find out where these representatives stand on TPP, and we're =\r\ngoing to do everything we can to make sure that they know the people they =\r\nrepresent want to defeat TPP.\r\n\r\nWe can only win if all of us get involved to stop TPP.\r\n\r\nIf TPP passes, there's no going back. The only way to get out of the trade =\r\ndeal - even to change a single word! - is if every one of the 12 nations =\r\nagree. That's not going to happen. So we need to defeat TPP now.\r\n\r\nBig corporate interests and Wall Street are lining up to help TPP pass =\r\nCongress when President Obama starts the fast track process. We've proven =\r\nbefore that when enough people stand together, we can beat those special =\r\ninterests. Now we need to do it again, starting with our day of action on =\r\nWednesday to reach our goal of 50,000 calls to Congress.\r\n\r\nSisters and Brothers, this is what we need you to do:\r\n\r\nThe first step to stopping TPP is showing a huge number of people oppose =\r\nit. Members of Congress and the media need to know that millions of people =\r\nwant to stop this trade deal.\r\n\r\nAdd your name and say that you want to stop TPP and have your voice =\r\ncounted:\r\n\r\nhttps://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/stop_tpp\r\n\r\nThanks for all you do for our movement.

They want someone who can speak to all Americans,\r\nof all walks of life. They want a candidate who can beat Hillary\r\nClinton. I'm going to be that candidate.\r\n \r\nBut this race is very far from over -- it's down to a three-man\r\nrace, but we have a lot of work to do.\r\n \r\nThere's no better time to join up with our movement -- will you\r\nchip in right now?\r\nhttp://email.hspdirect.com/ct/33711509:scTG8YCGN:m:3:1300916946:F7F862D8C54FDBB4C8ABA3AFBF4A4281:r\r\n \r\nSaturday night in South Carolina, I talked about the stakes of\r\nthis election: We cannot afford another eight years of failure.\r\nWe need our generation to step up and assume the mantle of\r\nleadership.\r\n \r\nWe know how to do this: When America was weakened just over a\r\ngeneration ago, Ronald Reagan led us back to the principles that\r\nmade our country the freest and most prosperous in the world.\r\n \r\nNow, the children of the Reagan Revolution are ready to lead. The\r\nconservative movement today is one where a son of a bartender and\r\na maid can be on the road to being president of the United\r\nStates, where a daughter of Indian immigrants has helped South\r\nCarolina prosper like never before, where a South Carolinian who\r\ngrew up in working poverty can become the first African-American\r\nsenator from the South in more than a century.\r\n \r\nIf you want to be a part of that movement, and help us win this\r\nfall, take the next step with me -- lend your support right now:\r\nhttp://email.hspdirect.com/ct/33711509:scTG8YCGN:m:3:1300916946:F7F862D8C54FDBB4C8ABA3AFBF4A4281:r\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nMarco Rubio\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nYes, Marco you can count on me!\r\nhttp://email.hspdirect.com/ct/33711509:scTG8YCGN:m:3:1300916946:F7F862D8C54FDBB4C8ABA3AFBF4A4281:r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaid for by Marco Rubio for President\r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThis message was intended for: 98xjsmith@gmail.com\r\nYou were added to the system February 18, 2016.

Conservatives can win this\r\nnomination, and we can have a conservative in the White House\r\nnext year.\r\n \r\nBut still, victory isn't going to come cheap or easy.

By contrast, Marco is\r\nby far the most popular Republican in the field right now. Polls\r\nshow that in head-to-head match-ups, Marco will defeat Trump,\r\nunite the party, and beat Hillary to win the White House.\r\n \r\nSo bottom line, if you want the Republican Party to unite and win\r\nin November, Marco is your guy.

Life Legal is appealing the NAF case to the\r\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals. \r\n                    \r\n                    We at Life Legal have been fighting hard to\r\ndefend David - to make sure that a lot of the later videos will\r\nbe seen by the public...\r\n                    \r\n                    But the latest pro-abort actions are designed\r\nto overwhelm David's legal team...to make it absolutely\r\nimpossible for him to stand up to the flood unleashed against\r\nhim! \r\n                    \r\n                    It's an old, old pro-abort strategy. Because\r\nthe pro-aborts are practically swimming in oceans of money-and\r\nreally, in oceans of blood money-they figure they can win court\r\nbattles by outspending the pro-life side. \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    The sad thing is that these new actions could\r\neasily be turned aside - and even made to serve the interest of\r\ntruth -- if Life Legal manages to raise the necessary funds...\r\n                    \r\n                    Indictments against David made good pro-abort\r\nheadlines for a day. But legal experts think that, with a\r\nreasonable defense, there won't be any convictions. \r\n                    \r\n                    As Judge Andrew Napolitano points out, the\r\ncrimes alleged are \"crimes of intent\" - and prosecutors can't\r\nshow any criminal intent on the part of journalists investigating\r\na shady enterprise. \r\n                    \r\n                      \r\n                    What's even better is that Planned\r\nParenthood's lawsuit opens it up to legitimate discovery - and\r\nits officers to questioning under oath! \r\n                    \r\n                    You can tell that the abortion\r\nmega-corporation is worried about this questioning- because they\r\nfailed to include \"defamation\" as a cause of action. \r\n                    \r\n                    If they had included \"defamation,\" they would\r\nhave been open to a level of discovery that they just couldn't\r\nface...\r\n                    \r\n                    As things stand, they are still playing a\r\ndangerous game. Discovery is very likely to reveal in court\r\nthings they want to keep hidden!\r\n                    \r\n                    That's if we can defend this case - and the\r\nother vindictive actions against David - the way we need to.\r\n                    \r\n                    Please...could you consider  helping us with\r\na timely contribution today? \r\n                    \r\n                    Considering the new challenges that have\r\ndescended this month, we at Life Legal estimate that weneed to\r\nraise $77,500 by the end of June  in order to provide David with\r\nthe defense he deserves - while attending to our many other vital\r\npro-life commitments. \r\n                    \r\n                    Because we are up against PP's billion-dollar\r\nwar chest - and because PP has enlisted government entities on\r\nits side - we are especially seeking gifts of up to $1,000 from\r\npro-lifers who can afford to consider such outstanding\r\ngenerosity. \r\n                    \r\n                    But we would be truly grateful for any amount\r\nyou could afford to give. We know from long experience that small\r\ngifts can do great things - if given with great love...\r\n                    \r\n                     \r\n                    I can tell you what Planned Parenthood and\r\nthe other pro-aborts are thinking right now. \r\n                    \r\n                    They're thinking that they have finally got\r\ncontrol of this whole video expos\u00e9 problem. They're thinking\r\nthat the dirty tricks of their media buddies have finally carried\r\nthe day, at least to some extent. \r\n                    \r\n                    And now they have turned the tables on the\r\ninvestigators! The pro-aborts are really proud of that. \r\n                    \r\n                    If their actions against David Daleiden\r\nsucceed, they will not only stop him: they'll scare away anybody\r\nelse who even thinks about standing up to them. In fact, they\r\nhave publicly declared this as their purpose!\r\n                    \r\n                    Then they can go right back to business as\r\nusual - serial abortions to cover up for child rapists, botched\r\nabortions smuggled to the hospital or to the morgue without\r\ncomment, and strong baby body parts sold to the highest\r\nbidder...unobserved and unchallenged! \r\n                    \r\n                     \r\n                    The pro-aborts are thinking that they are\r\nalmost ready to return to what they consider normal. \r\n                    \r\n                    But they are worried - because, after all,\r\nthe truth about Planned Parenthood has slipped out...\r\n                    \r\n                    Please...don't let them return to the\r\nbaby-killing business as usual! \r\n                    \r\n                    Please...help Life Legal stand up for David\r\nDaleiden - so that David Daleiden can stand up for the truth! \r\n                    \r\n                    Yours for the threatened child in the womb, \r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    Alexandra Snyder, Esq.\r\n                    Executive Director \r\n                    \r\n                    P.S.

First, in Winterset, Iowa, the birthplace of the legendary John Wayne, =\r\nI received the endorsement of John's daughter, Aissa.

We had 15,000 in attendance at the rally and it was a great e=\r\nvent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe massive crowd in Tulsa, OK\r\n\r\nOn Thursday I spoke to thousands at a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada. We are le=\r\nading all the Nevada state polls and the reception was incredible. Later th=\r\nat day I attended the Outdoor Sportsman Awards with my sons Don Jr. and Eri=\r\nc. We are all proud members of the NRA and they are excellent marksmen who =\r\nenjoy hunting, angling and more. In addition to Don and Eric, I was joined =\r\nby Willie Robertson.

I am proud to say that with your support we are =\r\nwell on our way to Making America Great Again!=C2=A0 Since the moment I rod=\r\ne down the escalator on June 16th, 2015 and decided to run for president, m=\r\ny campaign has been filled with nothing but excitement, dedication, and pas=\r\nsion to change our country for the better =E2=80=93 and this is only the be=\r\nginning of our movement!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday in Atlanta, Georgia we had thousands of loving supporters. Earlie=\r\nr in the=C2=A0campaign we had a record-setting rally in Mobile, Alabama wit=\r\nh over 30,000 attendees who joined our movement to Make America Great Again=\r\n.=C2=A0I am honored and proud to lead our fight to put America first. This =\r\npast year, I have traveled this great country and met many incredible Ameri=\r\ncans at our rallies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Republican primary began with 17 experienced and talented candidates fo=\r\nr president. Following the debate at the Ronald Reagan Library on September=\r\n 16th, your overwhelming support showed that our campaign has the message t=\r\nhat resonates with hard-working Americans=C2=A0and that the DC-centric way =\r\nof thinking is no longer capable of leading our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy campaign has been one of honesty and substance. We have created much-nee=\r\nded dialogue around the important issues facing our country. You've=\r\n seen my leadership in setting the agenda this whole political season on bo=\r\nth sides of the aisle. If I weren't running for president we wouldn=E2=80=\r\n=99t be talking about illegal immigration. We wouldn't be talking a=\r\nbout the drugs pouring in and the bad trade deals costing American jobs. We=\r\n wouldn't have called the terrorist attack in Orlando for what it i=\r\ns - radical Islamic terrorism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe support of many wonderful Americans like you led to resounding victorie=\r\ns in the Republican primary race, in which we beat the rigged political sys=\r\ntem and biased media with landslide victories. Our success began on Februar=\r\ny 9th with an emphatic win in New Hampshire and reached a high point with o=\r\nur victory in South Carolina on February 20th. We continued our success in =\r\nFlorida on March 15th followed by my home state of New York on April 19th =\r\n=E2=80=93 both huge turning points in our campaign. We had some tough losse=\r\ns along the way but with your support, we were able to bounce back and swee=\r\np the Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island primar=\r\nies on April 26th, along with other monumental wins throughout the primary =\r\nseason. The highlight was our win in Indiana on May 3rd - which made us the=\r\n presumptive Republican nominee!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strong vote of confidence that the American voters have placed in our m=\r\nessage of Making America Great Again=C2=A0has buoyed us to many victories a=\r\nnd is truly heartwarming. While I am thankful for the phenomenal success we=\r\n have enjoyed in the past year, it is just the beginning! I could not be mo=\r\nre thrilled to be your presumptive Republican Presidential Nominee and to o=\r\nfficially accept the GOP Nomination at the Convention in July. We must cont=\r\ninue to strive towards beating Crooked Hillary in November and Making ALL o=\r\nf America Great Again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you again for your support.\r\n\r\nBest Wishes,=C2=A0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDonald J.
